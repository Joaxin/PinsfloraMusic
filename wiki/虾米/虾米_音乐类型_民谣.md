民间流行的、富于民族色彩的歌曲，称为民谣或民歌。民谣的历史悠远，故其作者多不知名。民谣的内容丰富，有宗教的、爱情的、战争的、工作的，也有饮酒、舞蹈作乐、祭典等等。民谣既是表现一个民族的感情与习尚，因此各有其独特的音阶与情调风格。如法国民谣的蓬勃、意大利民谣的热情、英国民谣的淳朴、日本民谣的悲愤、西班牙民谣的狂放不羁、中国民谣的缠绵悱恻，都表现了强烈的民族气质与色彩。

Each country has their own folk music, but the genre usually refers to American and British music that has been passed through the generations by oral tradition. It's simple, acoustic-based music that spins everyday events and common people into mythic status. Many traditional folksongs have no known author, they have simply evolved over the years. Most of the earliest recorded folk music was of this nature, but with Woody Guthrie, topical folk began making its way to record. Still, many artists, including the Weavers and Pete Seeger, chose to mix traditional songs with newer material, either written by the artists themselves or other contemporary musicians. Initially, Bob Dylan functioned in that style, but by his second album, =The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,= he began relying entirely on original material, thereby ushering the modern era of folk, where most performers sang their own (usually personally and introspective) material, and only occasionally throwing in covers.

## Folk 民谣

民俗音乐（Folk music），又称民间音乐、民间歌谣、民间短篇诗歌等，简称民谣、民歌、民乐或民曲，于国际民间音乐协会（IFMC）之解释定义为“经过口传过程发展起来的普罗大众音乐”，也就是该音乐散布过程，纯粹是由演奏者或音乐接收者记录教习，并亲自相传所得。其范围包含歌曲、简单乐器演奏，甚至舞曲曲调与步伐。此解释与19世纪中期重新定义民间音乐、民间传说与民间舞蹈有相当重要之衍生与连带关系，一般认定，该名词与学说界定起自于1846年，英国人类学学者托马斯（W. J. Thomas）提出[来源请求]。
民间音乐有系统之定义研究虽起自19世纪，但实际形成却可溯自远古，例如中国春秋战国以前之诗经歌曲或今仍盛行之中国民歌等，亦可视为民间音乐。而不论古今或地区，民间音乐乐型态之传统要素与特性有下列几项：

1.民间音乐具有把现在与过去连结之连续性
2.个体与群体产生出不同类型的创作，并有其一定差异性
3.决定音乐形式或音乐存在，纯粹由社会力选择

民间流行的、富于民族色彩的歌曲，称为民谣或民歌。民谣的历史悠远，故其作者多不知名。民谣的内容丰富，有宗教的、爱情的、战争的、工作的，也有饮酒、舞蹈作乐、祭典等等。民谣既是表现一个民族的感情与习尚，因此各有其独特的音阶与情调风格。如法国民谣的蓬勃、意大利民谣的热情、英国民谣的淳朴、日本民谣的悲愤、西班牙民谣的狂放不羁、中国民谣的缠绵悱恻，都表现了强烈的民族气质与色彩。

民间流传的歌谣。有的内容与时事政治有关。近代作曲家，有用民谣为主题来创作各种乐曲的，如德沃夏克(antonin dvorák)的《自新大陆》交响曲、柴可夫斯基(peter llyitch tchaikovsky)的《第四交响曲》；丹第(vincentd'indy)的《山歌交响曲》；哈利斯(roy harris)的《民歌交响曲》；布鲁赫(mar bruch)的《苏格兰民歌协奏曲》；威廉士沃恩(williams vaughan)的《英吉利民歌组曲》；杜宾斯基(arcadydubensky)的《史蒂芬佛斯特组曲》；以及李亚道夫(anatol constantinovitch liadov)的《八段民歌管弦乐曲》等，皆为美妙动人的音乐，受到世人普遍的欢迎。

Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music.

Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted by mouth, as music of the lower classes, and as music with unknown composers. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. One meaning often given is that of old songs, with no known composers; another is music that has been transmitted and evolved by a process of oral transmission or performed by custom over a long period of time.

Starting in the mid-20th century a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This process and period is called the (second) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. This form of music is sometimes called contemporary folk music or folk revival music to distinguish it from earlier folk forms. Smaller similar revivals have occurred elsewhere in the world at other times, but the term folk music has typically not been applied to the new music created during those revivals. This type of folk music also includes fusion genres such as folk rock, folk metal, electric folk, and others. While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, in English it shares the same name, and it often shares the same performers and venues as traditional folk music. Even individual songs may be a blend of the two.

## Contemporary Folk 当代民谣

当代民谣Contemporary Folk作为民谣下一大分支，根源于传统民谣但同时受到流行音乐的影响，在越来越多的创作中融入了流行/摇滚乐的制作形式和除主力吉他外的器乐。在后期几十年中，当代民谣歌手也时有跨界进入流行音乐的领域，但他们在内容创作，歌词格式，现场表演地点的特殊偏好等依然保持着源自传统民谣的印记，同时歌手对生活和社会现实的认识，依然保持一种非常私人化的创作和歌唱表达方式。

当代民谣又被指的是Bob Dylan之后的70年代及以后的“民谣”创作人群体。在Dylan之前，多数“民谣”乐手演绎传统的“民谣”歌曲或者创作广泛的关注时下的歌曲，Dylan之后，“民谣”歌手改变了原先的方法，他们的音乐不仅拓宽了边界、也接受了某些“流行／摇滚”（Pop/Rock）音乐的制作技巧和配器，而且他们的歌曲日益内省，所关注的内容则由个体取代了社会，当然按时间段来区分也是值得商榷的。


Contemporary Folk refers to post-Bob Dylan folk singer/songwriters of the 70s and beyond. Prior to Dylan, most folk performers interpreted classic folk songs or wrote broad-based, topical songs. After Dylan, folk singers changed their approach. Not only did their music open up, accepting certain pop/rock production techniques and instrumentation, but their songs became increasingly introspective, concentrating on the personal instead of the social. In the decades to follow, contemporary folk singers sometimes crossed over into the pop mainstream, but their sound stayed rooted in folk traditions and they tended to frequent their own circles, releasing albums on independent labels and playing folk clubs and coffee houses.

## Indie Folk 独立民谣

Indie folk在1990年前后开始萌芽，独立摇滚圈的唱作人受到1950、1960、1960民谣和乡村音乐的影响，结合当代民谣的吉他原声和独立摇滚朗朗上口的旋律曲调创作出的新的歌曲形式。（早期的艺人有Lou Barlow, Jeff Buckley,Elliott Smith。）同时Indie folk和 freak folk, Psych folk, Baroque pop有着千丝万缕的联系，，在2000年一批优秀的艺人和乐队涌现了出来，包括 Bright Eyes, Beirut, Bon Iver, The Avett Brothers, Arthur & Yu, Fleet Foxes,The Decemberists,Iron & Wine, Okkervil River, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Noah and the Whale等，Indie folk由此也达到了一个新的受众高度。

Indie folk is a music genre that arose in the 1990s from singer/songwriters in the indie rock community influenced by the folk music scenes of the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, country music and indie rock.
A few early artists included Lou Barlow, Jeff Buckley and Elliott Smith. The genre is commonly related to freak folk, psych folk, baroque pop and New Weird America.The genre saw a significant growth from the early 2000s to present, beginning with acts such as Bright Eyes, Beirut, Bon Iver, The Avett Brothers, Arthur & Yu, Fleet Foxes, The Decemberists, Iron & Wine, Okkervil River, Manel, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Mumford & Sons, Noah and the Whale, The Mountain Goats, Cloud Control, Boy & Bear and others.

## Urban Folk 城市民谣

城市民谣始于七十年代，把黑人布鲁斯、爵士乐甚至雷吉音乐元素融入进来。保罗·西蒙和阿特·加芬克尔这个二重唱组，用高超的吉他弹奏，美妙的嗓音让城市民谣进入了和谐的技术的时代。以前民谣中的抗议之声由一种“蓝领摇滚”表达。美国城市民谣在八十年代又有了传人——崔西·查普曼（Tracy Chapman），另一位是苏珊娜·薇格（Suzanne Vega）。



Urban Folk was a movement of singer/songwriters in the '80s that grew out of punk rock. Urban folk musicians were initially inspired by punk rock but they performed solo, either with an acoustic or electric guitar. Urban folk was extremely political — the songs had basic melodies and direct, angry lyrics. Though there was only a small handful of urban folk musicians, they made a significant impact in the mid-'80s.

## Folk Pop 民谣流行

民谣流行音乐大致分为2种。一种是指流行音乐式编曲的民谣，另一种则是民谣式编曲的流行音乐。 民谣流行音乐最早出现在60年代初期，到了60年代中期开始逐渐风靡起来。不同于民谣摇滚，民谣流行音乐更为温和、优雅，更偏向于流行音乐。

Folk-Pop falls into two categories. Either it is folk songs with large, sweeping pop arrangements, or pop songs with intimate, acoustic-based folk arrangements. Folk-pop began to evolve in the early '60s, but it came into full force after folk-rock became a sensation in the mid-'60s. Folk-pop doesn't have ringing guitars and rougher edges of folk-rock; instead, it is softer, gentler, and more pop-oriented.

## Campus Folk 校园民谣

校园民谣就是广受学生喜爱，流行于校园，体现校园生活和学子心境或感受的创作，其或称为“校园歌谣”、“现代民歌”、“乐府民风”等等。校园民谣朝气蓬勃，极富有校园味道，毫无矫饰，完全是率真性情的流露，听起来十分感人，它形象地反映出青年学子的生活，表现出年轻人的蓬勃朝气、青春活力以及他们那富有诗意的浪漫气息，其曲风总体来说朴实明快、积极向上，充满活力，深受人们的喜爱和传唱。

校园民谣概念的首次出现，是在七十年代初的台湾。扬弦的《渡口》、赵树海的《子夜徘徊》、胡德夫的《少年中国》及"木吉他"全辑等。这些人的作品包括台湾民谣时代后期的大批校园歌手，如罗大佑、齐豫、侯德建、黄大成、红蚂蚁等，他们的涌现，构成了一个绝对经典的时代。

校园民谣在传入大陆后，逐渐成了一种音乐现象：它首先被那些对音乐有着执着追求的校园歌手们所吟唱、使之流行于中国大陆的各个高等学校，然后因为一个成功的商业运作迅速风靡了整个社会并产生了极大反响。校园民谣，它记录了一个时代、一种学校的文化氛围、一代莘莘学子的梦想与追求和对易逝的青春岁月的怀念。

## Traditional Folk 传统民谣

传统民谣融合十九世纪初期美国东部乡村地区的爱尔兰及苏格兰移民的民谣、德州弦乐曲及江湖走唱卖药歌而成，曲调轻松诙谐，好听悦耳，和缓温暖，大多以叙事及抒发感情为主，主要乐器是民谣吉他及斑鸠琴琴有时会佐以曼陀林、手风琴、小提琴、口琴极简单手鼓调味，洋溢着浓浓乡村香草味及校园民歌自弹自唱风情。


Traditional Folk refers to the folk songs of the first half of the 20th century, before folk became the province of personal singer/songwriters like Bob Dylan. Traditional folk tends to be written as universal truths, and often concerns big issues instead of private matters.

## Neofolk 新民谣

新民谣（Neo Folk）的精神源头可以追溯到上个世纪六十年代于欧美两地同时发生的民谣运动，后者对商业化和流俗文化的背叛也同时为新民谣所继承。
尽管新民谣音乐的主题对异教、浪漫主义、神秘主义多有涉及 其创作者也热衷于新古典音乐、军事音乐、后工业音乐和异教等繁杂的音乐类型和社会理念 。
但是它仍是一种根植于欧洲理念和后工业音乐的民谣音乐类型 。
原声吉它、钢琴和各种弦乐是这一类型偏爱使用的乐器 ，依据音乐主题和声音表现，新民谣的雏形期可以追溯到二十世纪六十年代 。

Neofolk is a form of folk music-inspired experimental music that emerged from post-industrial music circles. Neofolk can either be solely acoustic folk music or a blend of acoustic folk instrumentation aided by varieties of accompanying sounds such as pianos, strings and elements of industrial music and experimental music. The genre encompasses a wide assortment of themes. Neofolk musicians often have ties to other genres such as neoclassical and martial industrial.

## Psychedelic Folk 迷幻民谣

Psychedelic Folk若翻译为中文可理解为“迷幻民谣”，在很多时候它可以和另外一个风格名词"Acid Folk"等同。这种音乐的主要特点是以原色器乐演绎民谣风格歌曲，而对原色器乐这种颇为精细和冷旷的乐色的激进演绎，使得大部分 的作品显得颇为迷幻，是有Acid一说，这种音乐还有另一大有可听之处是它的选曲经常是很具有民族色彩，对各种民族乐器予以原色、迷幻而激进的演绎。

Psychedelic folk, psych folk or acid folk is a loosely defined form of psychedelic music that originated in the 1960s through the fusion of folk music and psychedelic rock. It retained the largely acoustic instrumentation of folk, but added musical influences common to psychedelic rock and the psychedelic experience.

## Progressive Folk 前卫民谣

前卫民谣最早是美国民谣歌曲在追求政治诉求时衍生出来的分支，但在英国变成不强调传统的民谣创作，更多的致力于新的文化创作，同时产生了新分支迷幻民谣，整体是受到前卫摇滚较大影响的。

Progressive folk or prog folk was originally a type of American folk music that pursued a progressive political agenda, but in the United Kingdom the term became attached to a sub-genre that rejects or de-emphasizes the conventions of traditional folk music and encourages stylistic or thematic innovation. It gave rise to the genre of psychedelic or psych folk and had a major impact on the development of progressive rock.

## Chamber Folk 室内民谣

Chamber Folk是指典雅、高贵、精致的一种民谣乐，它有一定的古典音乐感觉。 Chamber一词来自古典音乐，中文叫"室内乐"，是种小组弦乐演奏曲式，气氛高雅。Chamber Folk就是民谣的一类分支强调优美的旋律、精致的配乐、干净的录音，每每多用弦乐、管乐制造巴洛克时代的音乐感觉。Chamber Folk is a style of typically gentle fingerpicked acoustic guitar or harp-led music that initially gained prominence in the UK and the US during the mid-to-late 1960s. It is defined by an elegant and ornate style of arrangement and production, creating a sound that can be alternately described as wistful, fey, pastoral and whimsical, often featuring celestial, crystalline female vocals and a variety of instruments as accompaniment. These include, either separately or as part of an ensemble, piano, drums, harpsichord and various horns, woodwinds and stringed instruments (both orchestral and plucked).

While much of the style uses the traditional small ensemble sizes of Chamber Music within a non-classical acoustic style, Chamber Folk can also feature lush orchestral flourishes and similar aspects of arrangement found in other musical styles such as Baroque Pop, for example, Nico's Chelsea Girl and Joanna Newsom's Ys.

## Avant-Folk 先锋民谣

在原有民谣基础上突破常规，加入不同风格的实验元素。

## Anti-Folk 反民谣

反民谣的意思，并不就是反对民谣，而是强调不循规蹈矩。它是一种融合了民谣和朋克的音乐形态，他继承朋克音乐那尖刻的社会价值。如：Michelle Shocked、Roger Manning、Ani DiFranco。说到它的起源，不得不说一说1983年的那点儿破事。一个叫Lach的小青年带着自己的梦想来到了传说中的Folk City，渴望能够寻找到演出的机会。然而，老板在听了他的演出后，却说，你的音乐太朋克了。第二年，Lach自己在纽约东城区开了家名为the Fort的俱乐部。由于开业恰好撞上了纽约民谣艺术节，这个天生反骨的家伙就把the Fort的开业称为纽约反民谣艺术节。一年后，警方关闭了the Fort，于是the Fort就变成了一个流动性很强的反民谣演出场所。在1993年，反民谣已经得到了国际上的认可，并成为了多个艺人的垫脚石。Beck, Regina Spektor, 以及the Moldy Peaches，都是反民谣的代表人物。《纽约时报》曾在一篇报道中写道，他们（即以上提到的艺人）都有个共同的特征，那就是用颠覆传统且毫无惧怕的态度去创作。
到了2000年左右，反民谣的概念传入英国，并迅速在伦敦，曼彻斯特以及布莱顿的地下音乐圈中传播开来。直到2006年八月，在当月的Timeout杂志中，反民谣已经被认为是伦敦最热门的亚文化之一了。
从音乐来源看，反民谣主要来自于民谣与朋克。它继承了民谣的和缓和木吉他的伴奏，同时也吸收了朋克的激进，节奏以及大胆。它不再只拘泥于民谣对人生对世界亦或是对政治的忧郁和哀叹，它更多的是像朋克一般集中于自我以及自我与世界的关系。反之，它抛弃了朋克的简陋，无畏和大汗淋漓，而是采取了民谣的平静，冷眼旁观整个世界。而在歌词创作方面，反民谣大约可以分为两类。一类向流行靠近，另一类则向独立靠近。前者我们看到的是Regina Spektor，后者我们看到的是Kimya Dawson。歌词大多以简单的东西来表现歌曲的基调。在留给听者更多想象空间的同时，又不至于像听Bright Eyes似的消耗自己的脑细胞。而且，最要命的是，常常在这些简单哼唱的歌词中，我们听到的是更多更纯粹干净的温暖。
Lach在接受《纽约时报》的采访时曾说，刚开始的时候，我们是用民谣化朋克的方式来摇滚（When we started, we were to folk what punk was to rock.）。而当读到这句话的时候，我想到去年听Sonic Youth的新砖The Eternal时，曾读到过这样几句话，“民谣和朋克都对现状极度不满，两者以不同的方式逃避：民谣怀旧，通过退行到童年稚嫩、无辜、干净的状态，来维持起码的生存愿望；朋克破坏，通过否认仇视并破坏一切，在毁灭之后涅槃。”
可以说，民谣和朋克是音乐史上最激进的两种音乐。前者把一切都闷在心里，后者却毫无保留地表现出来。音乐史上从朋克转型到民谣，从民谣转型到朋克的音乐人都大有人在，诸如，Feist， Tony Dekker等。而反民谣，作为民谣与朋克的混合产物，让我们看到了其中和作用的奇妙反应物。或许少了民谣的内敛与深刻，少了朋克的张扬与无惧，但是反民谣的存在，却的确为这个世界上所不可缺少的。

## Celtic Folk 凯尔特民谣

在很多人心目中，凯尔特人即为爱尔兰民族，这也许是1922年爱尔兰共和国独立给公众造成的印象。事实上，凯尔特人原为公元前一千年左右居住在中欧、西欧的一些部落集团，经过漫长迁徒来到英伦，其后代今散落于爱尔兰、威尔士、苏格兰北部与西部山地各处。凯尔特人包括爱尔兰人、苏格兰高地人、威尔士人及康尼士人，他们大多操双语——英语和本族语(盖尔语或凯尔特语)，但往往不同地区的同族后辈，语言上会有较显著的差异。除了文字或文物研究可以证明他们之间的族源关系，最直接的方式是倾听他们用小竖琴和风笛奏出的音乐，那种古老的、源远流长的音乐，已成为连接不同地域凯尔特民族的文化纽带。

## Irish Folk 爱尔兰民谣

爱尔兰民谣特点是会加入本土特有的乐器，包括风笛、竖琴、肘风笛、锡哨、哨笛等，个人一种宁静致远的感觉。

## Scottish Folk 苏格兰民谣
## Dark Folk 黑暗民谣

Dark Folk was initially a term used interchangeably with Neofolk and "apocalyptic folk" to describe a range of Contemporary Folk music rooted in post-Industrial and Post-Punk, but today it refers mostly to a specific neofolk sub-genre which emerged in the mid-to-late 1990s. Unlike original "apocalyptic folk", it doesn't incorporate any post-industrial or post-punk influences. Instead, Ambient and Nordic Folk Music elements can often be heard. Also, experimental and apocalyptic nature of pioneering neofolk bands is rejected in favour of more melancholic and minimalist soundscapes. Vocals can be hushed, whispered, ethereal, depressing and traditional folk influenced, although instrumental tracks are very common too. As far as lyrics are concerned, dark folk artists usually focus on "dark" themes such as desolation, depression or death as well as paganism, nature, history, etc. and they are often sang in languages native to performers. Due to lyrical and stylistic overlap, dark folk is closely related to Metal (most notably Black Metal) music with many artists combining these two genres.

Ulver's Kveldssanger is widely considered as one of its earliest and most important releases, but dark folk has roots in the original neofolk movement as well, most notably Fire + Ice whose impact on the German scene was huge. Other key artists who helped to establish the genre include Orplid, Tenhi, Empyrium, Forseti, Darkwood and many other, mostly German and Nordic, bands and musicians. Today the most important dark folk scenes are located in Germany, Finland, Norway and Russian Federation.

## Freak Folk 奇幻民谣

奇幻民谣较好概括了一股嬉皮士民谣音乐风潮。波西米亚服饰、无处不在的世界元素采风，多语言组建的歌词，稠密的大胡子，艳丽的巫师长袍以及深靴，游离的人生轨迹等等，和美国60年代的氛围紧密贴合起来。

Freak folk is a genre of folk music which uses mainly acoustic instrumentation, but introduces elements of avant-garde music, baroque pop, and psychedelic folk, often featuring uncommon sounds, lyrical themes, and vocal styles.

## Medieval Folk 中世纪民谣

Neo-Medieval Folk (aka Medieval Folk) is meant to emulate European Folk Music from the Middle Ages. The genre emerged in 1980s in Germany from the Neo-Medieval movement and is characterised by the use of traditional instruments, such as bagpipe, hurdy gurdy, flute, nyckelharpa, tambourine, davul, goblet drum, shawm, bombard, cittern, tromba marina, timpani and lute. Songs are usually cheerful and energetic, but there are also more peaceful and solemn tunes. Artists frequently use medieval works, such as Carmina Burana, in their lyrics. The lyrical themes are not limited to Middle Ages though, as many bands also take inspiration from other periods.

Key examples of the genre include Faun, Corvus Corax and The Moon and the Nightspirit, among others.

## Middle Eastern Folk 中东民谣



## Neo-Traditional Folk 新传统主义民谣

在九十年代中期到末期，美国传统民谣曾经有过一次复兴，不仅仅是重录传统的谋杀歌谣和古老的小提琴曲调，也在用同样的方式书写并且表演。

During the mid- to late '90s, there was a resurgence of interest in American traditional folk music; not only re-recording the traditional murder ballads and old-timey fiddle tunes, but also writing and performing music in the same vein. The 1997 CD reissue of Harry Smith's 1952 landmark archive Anthology of American Folk Music seemed to kindle a spark in music fans much in the same way that the original LPs did in the early 50s (which eventually helped bring about the folk revival). Artists like Gillian Welch and Iris Dement who had been recording earthy folk music faithful to the Carter Family and Woody Guthrie found themselves attracting attention from an audience who would not consider themselves fans of country or folk music. The soundtrack to the 2000 film O Brother Where Art Thou found surprising success on the Billboard charts and ended up helping to revive the earnest feel of the acoustic folk music from the first half of the 20th century. Rooted in music from the Appalachian mountains and long honored dust bowl ballads, musicians like John Hartford, Norman Blake and Jay Ungar & Molly Mason recorded new songs based around traditional folk structures and themes, while artists such as the Handsome Family, Freakwater and Nickel Creek came at the music from a more progressive "alternative" slant, still evoking the honest, spiritual nature of this time-honored style.

## Swedish Folk 瑞典民谣

瑞典民谣早期有部分只有乐器演奏，到后来的本国语言的人声演唱相结合，多以欢快为主，让人舞蹈的。
Swedish folk music is a genre of music based largely on folkloric collection work that began in the early 19th century in Sweden. The primary instrument of Swedish folk music is the fiddle. Another common instrument, unique to Swedish traditions, is the nyckelharpa. Most Swedish instrumental folk music is dance music; the signature music and dance form within Swedish folk music is the polska. Vocal and instrumental traditions in Sweden have tended to share tunes historically, though they have been performed separately. Beginning with the folk music revival of the 1970s, vocalists and instrumentalists have also begun to perform together in folk music ensembles.
