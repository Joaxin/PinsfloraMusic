爵士乐是一种起源于非洲形成于美国的音乐形式。在它之前是一些更早出现的美国黑人音乐（如蓝调、福音歌曲等），而这些音乐是美国黑人根植于其非洲音乐传统的基础上，结合他们在现实中的遭遇创作出来的。早期蓝调主要表现黑人的悲惨境遇和底层生活状态（蓝调的英文原字Blue除了指‘蓝色’之外亦有‘忧郁’之意），大多比较凄苦。福音歌曲主要是（向上帝）祈求平安，希望得到救赎。爵士乐在其发展过程中除了有黑人音乐的根源外，还吸收了如古典音乐、民族音乐等诸多音乐元素，逐渐形成了今天多门多类的爵士乐，所传递的内容也更为多样，不只是早期的“黑人风格”。
爵士乐的根源
爵士乐源于蓝调，是一种从前居住在美国南部的非洲奴隶以及他们的后代们的民间音乐。蓝调深受西非文化和音乐传统的影响，这些奴隶也逐渐成为移居到城市的黑人的音乐家。
爵士乐的真正起源是贫穷。1865年，美国内战结束，往日黑人奴隶获得了自由，但是生活依然困苦。他们多数是文盲，唯有靠自己故土培植出的音乐娱乐自己。劳动的号子和农田歌曲是在采摘棉花时唱的，赞美诗歌和圣歌是在种族隔离的教堂里聚会时唱的，而即兴之作则是独唱歌手在一只班卓琴伴奏下吟唱的。在教堂中，黑人牧师用英国领唱方式来解决唱歌不懂字的问题。
上世纪之交流行的标准音乐会形式，也就是当时军乐团和舞会乐队的音乐，影响了最早的爵士乐的主流表达方式。这些音乐的乐器：铜管乐器，簧管乐器和鼓，成为了爵士乐的基本乐器。
在不到一个世纪的时间内，这种名叫爵士乐的音乐，具有显著美国特色的音乐从默默无闻、起源于民间的音乐发展成为美国本土产生的最有份量的艺术种类。如今在全世界几乎每个角落都有人聆听和演奏它。爵士乐以如此众多的形式出现，而且每一种形式都相当重要，都保持了自己的特色及独具的魅力而流传至今。如果要欣赏各种爵士乐，体会个中种种乐趣，就不能不需要拥有开放的态度，兼容并听。
Jazz has been called America's classical music, and for good reason. Along with the blues, its forefather, it is one of the first truly indigenous musics to develop in America, yet its unpredictable, risky ventures into improvisation gave it critical cache with scholars that the blues lacked. At the outset, jazz was dance music, performed by swinging big bands. Soon, the dance elements faded into the background and improvisation became the key element of the music. As the genre evolved, the music split into a number of different styles, from the speedy, hard-hitting rhythms of be-bop and the laid-back, mellow harmonies of cool jazz to the jittery, atonal forays of free jazz and the earthy grooves of soul jazz. What tied it all together was a foundation in the blues, a reliance on group interplay and unpredictable improvisation. Throughout the years, and in all the different styles, those are the qualities that defined jazz.

爵士乐(Jazz)以其极具动感的切分节奏、个性十足的爵士音阶和不失章法的即兴演奏（或演唱）赢得了广大听众的喜爱，同时也得到了音乐领域各界人士的认可。它以布鲁斯和拉格泰姆为源头，经过整整一个世纪的发展，如今已是异彩纷呈、百花齐放。自从1917年第一张爵士唱片诞生以来,它便显示出了巨大的发展潜力。20世纪初的新奥尔良爵士乐 、30 年代大乐队演奏的摇摆乐、40年代的比博普爵士、40 年代末的冷爵士、50年代的硬博普、60 年代的自由爵士、70 年代以后的摇滚爵士，而后拉丁爵士、融合爵士、爵士放克…… 一张张不同风格的爵士唱片汇成了一部爵士乐发展史。
Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime. Jazz is seen by many as "America's classical music". Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as "one of America's original art forms"

Classic Jazz refers more to a transitional era (1920s), rather than any specific style. During the 1920s jazz slowly shifted from the exuberant New Orleans and Dixieland styles toward a more sophisticated and urbane swing style. Many artists who participated in this transition had careers that overlapped into Dixieland in the early 20s, and into swing in the middle 30s. Not only was the music shifting during this time, but the performing ensembles were growing bigger as more dance orchestras began to use jazz elements creating a big band jazz/pop hybrid that would lead to the classic big bands of the swing era.

The leaders of classic 1920s jazz are orchestra leader Fletcher Henderson and his star soloist, Louis Armstrong. The Henderson orchestra did away with the constant polyphonic soloing of New Orleans jazz and replaced it with cool relaxed riffing which provided a background for Armstrong's expressive melodies and exciting solos. Classic jazz is still played by jazz lovers all over the world, although not always with the right feel.

  ## Bossa Nova 巴萨诺瓦

巴萨诺瓦(Bossa Nova)是一种融合巴西森巴舞曲和美国酷派爵士的一种“新派爵士乐”，承袭choro和samba-cancao的部分特色而又自成一格，乍听简洁轻快。巴萨诺瓦结构复杂；乐器的音阶或和弦转换的行进方式变幻莫测，往往乍听下以为可以掌握旋律的起落和节奏，和弦一转换后即捕足不及。它的旋律可以是行板或中板速度进行。

语源

巴萨诺瓦(Bossa Nova)是葡萄牙文，Bossa原意是演奏Samba时的自然风格与气质，Nova则是新的意思。结合起来，Bossa Nova就是一种融合了传统巴西森巴(samba)节奏与啼乐(choro)的一种"新派音乐"。正统的Bossa Nova的起源是南美洲巴西土生土长的音乐，之后流传到北美洲之后广为爵士乐坛所喜爱，由美国爵士乐手大力推广。也因此“Bossa Nova是拉丁爵士的一种”的这个印象，已经是后来的事情了。

风格

巴萨诺瓦的字面意思是“新节奏”，原来是一种拉丁音乐，听起来轻松柔和、慵懒甜美、浪漫性感。与传统南美及拉丁音乐不同的是，巴萨诺瓦不像森巴或伦巴(Rumba)那样节奏强烈，除拥有南美音乐的热情外，还带有一份慵懒和轻松的感觉。

历史

巴萨诺瓦在1950年代末期的巴西兴起。 1959年，由法国导演Marcel Camus执导的巴西电影“黑色奥菲斯”(Black Orpheus)勇夺康城电影节、奥斯卡、金球奖三项最佳外语片奖； 带有巴萨诺瓦风格的电影主题曲“A Felicidade”和“Desafinado”风行一时，人们开始对巴萨诺瓦产生兴趣。1960年代美国更掀起一阵巴萨诺瓦风潮，延烧到世界各地，影响了往后1970、80年代的电影及流行音乐。

在亚洲的发展

日本在1960年代中期就流行巴萨诺瓦，闻名国际的萨克斯风手渡边贞夫就是日本推动巴萨诺瓦的先锋。日本的许多音乐人常表演巴萨诺瓦；除渡边贞夫外，还有李敬子、小野丽莎、铃木重子等爵士艺人，都有不少巴萨诺瓦的作品，其中小野丽莎更被定位为巴萨诺瓦歌手。
踏入21世纪，巴萨诺瓦在台湾开始有流行的趋势，频频在广告中出现，可说是历久弥新的“新节奏”。

Bossa nova is a genre of Brazilian music, which was developed and popularized in the 1950s and 1960s and is today one of the best-known Brazilian music genres abroad. The phrase bossa nova means literally "new trend" or "new wave" (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈbɔsɐ ˈnɔvɐ] (About this sound listen)). A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following in the 1960s, initially among young musicians and college students.
Although it had been developing throughout the 50s, Bossa Nova became popular in the early 60s as a more mellow alternative to the aggressive urban sounds of hard bop and the avant-garde. Bossa Nova was a Brazilian concoction that combined simplified and slowed down samba rhythms, relaxed cool jazz sensibilities and modern European impressionistic harmonies into a music that was pleasing, but hardly simplistic. The pulsing relaxed rhythm, marked with hypnotic accents, that defines Bossa Nova can be heard in the songs and guitar rhythms of Joao Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim.

  ## Jazz Pop 爵士流行

六十年代末期，爵士乐经历了一次危机，年轻的听众喜爱灵魂乐与摇滚乐，老一辈的乐迷则不再迷恋于那些大多数抽象且感情不足的现代爵士乐，爵士乐手意识到如果想挽回听众的心，他们势必要在爵士乐中吸取一些流行音乐的要素，而灵魂乐与摇滚乐就成为他们这种概念最佳来源。这样的音乐形式通常被称为融合爵士（Fusion）。
Jazz-Pop就是融合爵士下面的一种形式，爵士流行既保持了布鲁斯音阶和演唱音色的运用，但同时又把握流行乐的特点：通俗易懂朗朗上口，保证了内容的可传递性。

  ## Swing 摇摆乐

摇摆乐不同于先前的新奥尔良爵士乐和迪克西兰爵士乐，通常乐队中的合奏更为简化，同时是作为更为成熟的独奏之间的反复演奏的连复段。而个人的即兴演奏也是主要是密切的建立在旋律的基础之上，其原因主要是由于音乐技法的进步。同以前的演奏相比，独奏的演绎更具有冒险性。在大乐队时代结束之后，摇摆乐风格的音乐家仍然坚持这种风格演出，他们的演奏堪称是一种主流的爵士乐。真正摇摆乐在流行乐坛的确立则要算是1935年Benny Goodman大乐队的成功，直至1946年大乐队时代的结束为止，摇摆乐一直是美国流行音乐的一支重要的力量。摇摆乐不同于先前的新奥尔良爵士乐和迪克西兰爵士乐，通常乐队中的合奏更为简化，同时是作为更为成熟的独奏之间的反复演奏的连复段。而个人的即兴演奏也是主要是密切的建立在旋律的基础之上，其原因主要是由于音乐技法的进步。同以前的演奏相比，独奏的演绎更具有冒险性。在大乐队时代结束之后，摇摆乐风格的音乐家仍然坚持这种风格演出，他们的演奏堪称是一种主流的爵士乐。

Swing music, or simply swing, is a form of popular music developed in the United States that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the off–beat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb "to swing" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, Woody Herman, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Shep Fields, Sammy Kaye, Harry James and Cab Calloway.

The Swing genre represents a golden age for jazz that showed its first signs in the mid-20s, but really peaked from the mid-30s to the mid-40s. Going well into the 20s, most jazz bands still played in New Orleans or Dixieland styles in which the musicians all improvised simultaneously while staying within the boundaries of the original tune's melody and harmony.

When cornetist Louis Armstrong joined Fletcher Henderson's Orchestra in 1924, the band's arranger, Don Redman, knew he had a rare talent on his hands and began to spotlight Armstrong's melodic skills. No longer would the entire band improvise, instead Armstrong would be given the freedom to take solos to new heights while the rest of the band supplied supporting riffs. This new approach to band arranging spread and reached the public at a time when people were looking for large orchestral bands that could provide an evening's worth of dance music. Thus the golden age for big band jazz was born.

From 1935 to about 1946 jazz dance bands led by the likes of Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington were the number one form of entertainment in the US. The swing era finally came to an end when new taxation laws on nightclubs made dance floors unprofitable and jazz became an entertainment for listening, not dancing.

  ## Smooth Jazz 柔顺爵士

Smooth Jazz发现到现在已经二十多年了，如果追溯到起源，从各种各样的档案资料里都可以找到，Smooth Jazz是Fusion(融合爵士)的一种衍生物，在其音乐当中，音乐家们不再把他们的精力投入到即兴创作及演奏当中去，而是更加注重音乐的旋律化，以及和R&B等其它音乐之间的融合能力。的确， 当George Benson, Bob James, Grover Washington Jr. 等一批Smooth Jazz先驱把这样一种新型的现代爵士音乐类型带进唱片公司录音间的那一时刻开始，Smooth Jazz就注定和“商业”，“流行”，“现代”这些词汇紧紧联系，永不分离。但这些大师们把他们的音乐推销给千家万户以后，很多人都会有这样的一种感慨：“原来爵士乐还可以这样玩”。注意，他们提到了“爵士乐”这个词，可以见得他们的音乐还是爵士音乐，再退一步讲，他们音乐的根源是爵士乐而在这二十年来，这样的一种音乐发生了什么样的一种变化呢，其实只要听听我开始提到的那三首单曲之后，答案就很明显了。“Smooth Jazz不再爵士了”。 虽然这样一个结论不是绝对的，比如大量的以传统爵士作为根源的Smooth Jazz仍在不断继续的发展，但广义的Smooth Jazz 队伍明显庞大了许多，这正是因为越来越多的和爵士音乐并无多少关联的音乐加入到这个队伍当中
Smooth Jazz本身就是一种非常时尚的音乐类型，当然要领导这个潮流就需要不断的变化，在前两年Chill-Out音乐以及Lounge音乐风靡的时候，很多Smooth Jazz音乐家以及业内人事都嗅到了其在现代爵士音乐领域的巨大商业潜力，很快以Acid-Jazz这种非常电子化的爵士音乐为基础，加入大量的Ambient元素的音乐开始大行其道，比如英国音乐家Paul Hardcastle的Jazzmassters系列以及Hardcastle系列就是非常典型的范例，而在今年2月又一群欧洲的DJ共同发行的合辑《Rendezvous Lounge》其实是一张地地道道的电子类Down-tempo的音乐唱片，但其发行以及推广都是在Smooth Jazz领域里完成的，而且被业内人士打了非常高的分，作为一张经典现代Smooth Jazz来宣传。这些音乐当中经常也能找到一些爵士的影子，但只不过是用来为他们的时尚音乐点缀罢了。

Smooth Jazz已经不只是代表Smooth了的爵士音乐了，因为Smooth Jazz作为独立的一种音乐形式的趋势已经越来越明显了，而这种独立不仅仅是在音乐本身，还是发生在所有相关的商业体系。这样看来，“Smooth Jazz不再爵士”就不奇怪了，甚至成为了这种音乐发展的必然趋势， 但却不会被诸如New Age音乐的其它音乐形式所吞并，反而会有可能包容其它的音乐形式，其魅力根源就来自它巨大的商业背景。

Smooth Jazz is an outgrowth of fusion, one that emphasizes its polished side. Generally, smooth jazz relies on rhythms and grooves instead of improvisation. There are layers of synthesizers, lite-funk rhythms, lite-funk bass, elastic guitars, and either trumpets, alto, or soprano saxophones. The music isn't cerebral, like hard bop, nor is it gritty and funky like soul-jazz or groove -- it is unobtrusive, slick, and highly polished, where the overall sound matters more than the individual parts.

  ## Jazz Fusion 融合爵士

融合爵士兴起于七十年代，是爵士乐的分支之一。只要你有足够的创新意识和胆量，任何音乐都可以成为爵士乐的调料。如今所谓的融合爵士一般是指在爵士乐的基础上融合了摇滚乐、世界音乐等成分，同时也融进一些流行音乐元素的爵士风格。因此，融合爵士给人的感觉是既新鲜又流行，而又不失爵士乐的色彩。
从乐队上看，融合爵士打破了传统爵士乐队一直以原声乐器为主体的原则，它大量的使用电声乐器和电子乐器，使其更具现代气息。比如用电贝司代替原声贝司，用电子合成器代替钢琴，电吉他使用效果器（传统爵士乐一般不使用使用效果器）等做法都是一次大胆的创新。从节奏形态上看，融合爵士经常加强鼓和贝司的力度，制造出奔腾不息的节奏律动，钢琴和吉他也从原来演奏旋律声部转变为节奏乐器。这种不规则的低音线条，疯狂的贝司击弦，厚重的摇滚节拍加上爵士乐的规则，有时又被称为爵士放克（Jazz Funk）。总之，融合爵士的电气味重了，流行味浓了，因此被人接受的可能度也就大了。
Jazz fusion (also known as fusion) is a musical genre that developed in the late 1960s when musicians combined aspects of jazz harmony and improvisation with styles such as funk, rock, rhythm and blues, and Latin jazz. During this time many jazz musicians began experimenting with electric instruments and amplified sound for the first time, as well as electronic effects and synthesizers. Many of the developments during the late 1960s and early 1970s have since become established elements of jazz fusion musical practice.
Rock and RnB came from jazz in the 1940s via the jump blues genre. Needless to say, over the years jazz, rock and RnB have enjoyed a close relationship and have cross-influenced each other from the beginning. In the mid to late 60s, rock and RnB under went major changes with rock becoming much louder and more experimental under the influence of artists such as Jimi Hendrix and Cream, while RnB became more syncopated and abstract with the new funk sound created by James Brown, Bootsy Collins, Sly Stone and Larry Graham. Meanwhile, Latin jazz was undergoing similar experimental changes under the guidance of artists such as Hermato Pascoal and Flora Purim.

At this point in the mid to late 60s, any intersection between jazz, rock, funk and Latin became a radically different form of music that eventually came to be called fusion.

  ## Jazz Funk 爵士放克

放克爵士乐（Jazz funk），是1960年代受放克影响而发展出来的一种爵士乐风格，特色是强列的Backbeat，即兴演奏比重较放克音乐要多，与同时期的融合爵士乐相似使用大量电子乐器、合成器。
Jazz-funk is a subgenre of jazz music characterized by a strong back beat (groove), electrified sounds and an early prevalence of analog synthesizers. The integration of funk, soul, and R&B music and styles into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is quite wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs, and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.

  ## Acid Jazz 酸性爵士

酸爵士（英语：Acid Jazz），又译迷幻爵士，源于英国英格兰南部，是爵士乐的一种分支音乐类型，结合了部分灵魂乐、放克音乐（Funk）和迪斯科成分，尤其是循环拍子和调式和声方面。它在1980年-1990年间开始发展，由最初类似爵士放克（Jazz-funk）风格，转型至类似电子舞曲和波普音乐的混合。吉尔斯·彼得森（Gilles Peterson）和埃迪·皮尔勒（Eddie Piller）也成立了一家同样名为“酸爵士”（Acid Jazz Record，简称 Acid Jazz）的英国唱片公司，旗下歌手皆会唱酸爵士音乐。唱片公司愿意专为酸爵士出唱片，可见它很受欢迎（见右图）。酸爵士包含很多电子音乐元素，而且很适合作现场即兴改版演出，所以歌手都很喜欢在其演唱会演唱酸爵士歌曲。英格兰乐队“匿名者”（Incognito）和“新重骑兵”（Brand New Heavies）的演唱尤其着重酸爵士的和弦特质。酸爵士的发展也可算作爵士放克、灵魂爵士的复兴。因为多种乐器可作现场即兴演出，加上酸爵士特殊的编曲模式，让唱片骑师的“刮擦”技术得以体现 ─ 这协助诺曼·杰伊（Norman Jay）、吉尔斯·彼得森、帕特里克·福奇（Patrick Forge）等唱片骑师打响知名度。酸爵士的常用乐器包括：萨克斯管、小号、长号、单簧管、钢琴、吉他、低音提琴、鼓。
酸性爵士这类音乐是成长在爵士、funk、hip-hop之间的音乐。酸性爵士有三个基本元素：它作为一个极富力度的撞击而存在，起初的风格类似于爵士和非洲古巴舞曲，但是它又固执的游离在funk,hip-hop和舞曲音乐之间。1998年，最初它出现在作为美国唱片的说明性短语和重新发行的70年代的英语歌收录辑系列的标题中，被Brits称作在80年代中期再现的特别的夹缝音乐。
Acid jazz is a musical genre that combines elements of jazz, funk and hip-hop, particularly looped beats. It developed in the UK over the 1980s and 1990s and could be seen as tacking the sound of jazz-funk onto electronic dance: jazz-funk musicians such as Roy Ayers, Donald Byrd and Grant Green are often credited as forerunners of acid jazz. Acid jazz has also experienced minor influences from soul, house, and disco.
While acid jazz often contains various types of electronic composition (sometimes including sampling or live DJ cutting and scratching), it is just as likely to be played live by musicians, who often showcase jazz interpretation as part of their performance. The compositions of groups such as Jamiroquai, Galliano, Urban Species, The Brand New Heavies and Incognito often feature chord structures usually associated with jazz music.
The acid jazz "movement" is also seen as a revival of jazz-funk or jazz fusion or soul jazz by leading DJs such as Norman Jay or Gilles Peterson or Patrick Forge, also known as "rare groove crate diggers" or "Cataroos".
Q magazine stated "Acid jazz was the most significant jazz form to emerge out of the British music scene".

Jazz music community with review and forums
Acid jazz grew out of the late 80s DJ scene in London in which record spinners would treat dancing patrons to difficult to find 45s released by 60s soul jazz artists. Eventually contemporary lounge/jazz performers such as James Taylor began to capitalize on this interest in 60s 'rare groove' and began to perform live music that had equal appeal for the trendy club crowd. Another aspect of early Acid Jazz involved the mixing of 60s RnB-jazz with the sounds and rhythms of acid house. Once Acid Jazz left England, confusion as to what it actually was created a diversity of influences including dub reggae, hip-hop, drumnbass and 60s psychedelic rock. More recently Acid Jazz is often seen as either 60s rare groove, or a merging of jazz with trip-hop or other club friendly electronica sounds and rhythms.
Typically the artists listed in JMA's acid jazz genre are live bands while acid jazz artists who are more DJ based are listed in our DJ/Electronica jazz genre.

  ## African Jazz 非洲爵士

African Jazz是南非的爵士音乐，结合了非洲狂放的节奏，在美国，非洲爵士的形成深受黑人音乐风格的影响。 第一次世界大战之后，一支来自美国新奥尔良的迪克西兰乐队给南非带来爵士的第一缕声响。在此期间，昆斯敦成为南非爵士乐发展的要点。As in the United States, South African jazz was strongly influenced by the music styles of the black population. That said influences from the US led to its formation. The first jazz in the country was done by a Dixieland band from New Orleans that came to the nation after World War I. In this period Queenstown would be an important point in the development of a South African jazz. Boet Gashe and William Mbali's Big Four were among the early jazz successes in South Africa, although both had relationship to the blues as well. Later the Jazz Maniacs entered the scene and mixed influences from Marabi music to Duke Ellington.

  ## Afro-Cuban Jazz 非洲古巴爵士

古巴爵士（Afro-Cuban Jazz），也叫非洲古巴爵士，它被认为是拉丁爵士的发端，也深深影响了拉丁爵士的发展。非裔古巴的打击乐，融合进了爵士乐的特色，再加入点波普和摇摆乐、放克，便形成了独一无二的古巴爵士。古巴爵士承袭了古巴音乐微妙宁静和强而有力的双重品格，轻佻又不失轻柔。古巴爵士偏重于打击乐器和旋律，康加鼓Conga、沙槌Maracas、三弦吉他Tres等富有古巴特色的乐器，与传统管弦乐器交相呼应。拉丁美洲人民天生活泼喜悦，有属于自己的节奏律动，这种律动也是古巴爵士最重要的节奏模式，它叫Clave Rhythm。由于节奏和旋律都非常活泼跳跃，因此你听古巴爵士，会情不自禁跟着摇摆起来，无拘无束的音乐氛围令人陶醉其中。古巴爵士诞生于20世纪40年代早期（另一种说法是20至30年代），它的形成，归功于Mario Bauzá（马里奥·鲍扎）、Machito（马奇托）、Dizzy Gillespie（吉尔斯比）、Chano Pozo（加诺·波佐）这几位艺术家不懈的努力与推动。
可以毫不夸张地说，古巴爵士之于古巴，就如同巴萨诺瓦之于巴西一样，它俨然成为了古巴最重要的文化遗产之一。
非洲古巴爵士，将来自于古巴和非洲的节奏与爵士乐的即兴创作结合在一起的爵士乐类型。它也被人们称为拉丁爵士(Latin Jazz).但一些演奏者还是更喜欢用“非洲古巴爵士”这个词。古巴爵士有时也被称作为非洲古巴爵士，在所有后-摇摆乐的形式中，古巴爵士向来最受青睐。原因很简单：它对于打击乐器和古巴旋律的偏重，使得这一音乐形式相当合适跳舞，且易于理解。
20世纪20-30年代，有个别的爵士音乐家在他们的音乐中运用南美洲的节奏和拉丁流行乐元素。促使这种音乐产生的人是马里奥·鲍扎（Mario Bauza)，他是一位小号手兼编曲家。他把小号大师吉尔斯比（Dizzy Gillespie）介绍给了古巴打击乐大师加诺·波佐(Chano Pozo)。两人在1947年—1948年间共同创作了不少新颖的音乐，直到波佐去世。也正在是鲍扎的介绍下，拉丁乐队领袖马奇托（Machito)才是开始使用独奏爵士乐手。
20世纪40年代末，斯坦肯顿（Stan Kenton)开始在他的音乐里结合拉丁节奏。
20世纪50年代，这股风气开始盛行，“非洲古巴爵士”成为最流行的爵士风格之一。
近代的一些乐队在非洲古巴爵士的波普(Bop)根源基础之上加入疯克（Funk）元素并引入更多的独奏。这种音乐的精髓就是北美、南美、和中美的真正融合。重点就是具有感染力的节奏。

Afro-Cuban Jazz is a combination of jazz improvising and rhythms from Cuba and Africa; it is also known as Latin jazz. There were some hints of Afro-Cuban jazz in isolated cases during the 1920s and '30s — Jelly Roll Morton's "Spanish tinge" in some of his more rhythmic piano solos, a few Gene Krupa performances where he sought to include South American rhythms, and even in the Latin pop music of Xavier Cugat. However, the true birth of Afro-Cuban jazz can be traced to trumpeter-arranger Mario Bauza. Bauza introduced trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie to the masterful Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo (they teamed up in 1947-48 to create innovative music before Pozo's death) and also persuaded Latin bandleader Machito to use jazz soloists. During the late '40s, Stan Kenton began to integrate Latin rhythms in his music, and with the rising popularity of Tito Puente and Cal Tjader during the 1950s, Afro-Cuban jazz caught on as one of the most popular jazz styles. In more recent times some groups have developed Afro-Cuban jazz beyond its boppish roots, performing Thelonius Monk and John Coltrane tunes, adding funk to the mixture, and having more adventurous solos. The spirit of the music — a true fusion between North, South, and Central America — and an emphasis on infectious rhythms are the keys. — Scott Yanow
Afro-Cuban Jazz combines traditional African based rhythms from Cuba with the pyrotechnical solos of jazz or fusion. This genre got its start when Mario Bauza introduced bop trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie to Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo. The two made exciting new music together starting in 1947 and ending abruptly in 1948 when Pozo passed away. About this same time Cuban bandleader Machito began to feature jazzy solos in his band arrangements. With the rise of artists such as Tito Puente, Afro-Cuban jazz became one of the most popular styles of jazz in the 1950s.

Afro-Cuban is still one of the more popular styles of jazz today and continues to grow and evolve as it takes on influences from fusion and even the avant-garde. You can also check our genres; Latin Jazz, Bosasa Nove and World Fusion for other styles of Latin Jazz.

  ## Avant-Garde Jazz 先锋爵士

前卫的爵士乐（也称为前卫爵士乐）是一种音乐和即兴创作风格，将前卫的艺术音乐与爵士乐融为一体。它起源于20世纪50年代，并发展到20世纪60年代。最初是自由爵士乐的代名词，但是非常前卫的爵士乐与这种风格截然不同。先锋爵士乐可以是非常自由的，因为音乐家不用遵循某个规定好的结构，先锋爵士可能是极其嘈杂的，也可能是极其安静的。Avant-Garde最先被用在Free-Jazz运动刚爆炸的时候；拿来形容Ornette Coleman这些乐手；德布希的改变钢琴史的作法也被视为Avant-Garde，当然；实验性质强烈的剧场音乐更具有Avant-Garde Jazz的风格。

Avant-garde jazz (also known as avant-jazz) is a style of music and improvisation that combines avant-garde art music and composition with jazz. It originated in the 1950s and developed through the 1960s. Originally synonymous with free jazz, much avant-garde jazz was distinct from that style.
The Avant-garde Jazz genre at JMA generally consists of jazz that is usually atonal, and quite often a-rhythmic as well. Avant-garde jazz can be ‘free’, in that there is no prescribed structure for the musicians to follow, or there may be some sort of compositional structure being used as well. Other factors that can result in an avant-garde tag include the use of extremes, such as extremely loud music, or extremely quiet music etc. Also, experimental presentations can be considered, such as a piece where the performers are playing without being able to hear each other, or all of the musicians are submerged in water, etc. Generally the Avant-garde Jazz genre is reserved for musicians from a jazz background, but JMA also includes some non-jazz avant-garde musicians in our Jazz Related Improvisation/Composition genre.

  ## Big Band 大乐队

又译大乐队或大乐队时代，是演奏爵士乐的乐团，流行于美国30年代初到50年代末的摇摆年代(Swing Era)。大乐团的编制通常有10到25位乐手，包括演奏萨克斯风、小喇叭、伸缩喇叭、铁琴的乐手，还有歌手以及负责节奏乐器的乐手。20年代末期出现的新型大乐队有更多即兴的成分。但这类型的爵士乐不若为跳舞而演奏的爵士乐来得受欢迎，期间只有少数音乐被录制成唱片，所制成的唱片被称为‘民族唱片’(Race records)，听众也只限于少数的都市人口，且只有极少数的白人乐手熟悉这类曲风。这类曲风主要在纽约市、芝加哥、堪萨斯市发展。
A Big Band is a type of musical ensemble that usually consists of ten or more musicians with four sections: saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. Big bands originated during the early 1910s and dominated jazz in the early 1940s when swing was most popular. The term "big band" is also used to describe a genre of music. One problem with this usage is that it overlooks the variety of music played by these bands.
Big bands started as accompaniment for dancing. In contrast with the emphasis on improvisation, big bands relied on written compositions and arrangements. They gave a greater role to bandleaders, arrangers, and sections of instruments rather than soloists.
The Big Band genre at JMA is for large ensembles (generally ten or more musicians) who play in what best can be called a "big band style". The big band style involves breaking the large ensemble into separate sections, usually grouped by instrument, that then engage in call and response type figures with each other. These motifs can be arranged or improvised. The big band arranging style can also use repeating interlocking riffs by the various sections that provide a rhythmic groove for soloists. Early innovators in big band music include Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Benny Goodman. Modern big band leaders include Quincy Jones and Maynard Ferguson.
The Big Band genre at JMA also includes jazz influenced pop orchetra leaders such as Paul Whiteman, Glen Miller and the Dorsey Brothers. Modern big bands that are influenced by avant-garde music, 3rd stream music or other types of modern elements can be found in the Progressive Big Band genre.

  ## Bop 波普

比波普，亦称Bop可以看作是现代爵士的前身，由演奏摇摆乐的小乐队发展而来，注重表现演奏技巧和复杂和声，而不是演奏适合人演唱的旋律，这种风格影响了以后各种爵士乐。一种激进的爵士乐风格，可看作是现代爵士乐的前身。出现于20 世纪40 年代中期，由爵士小号手约翰· 伯克斯、古莱斯皮和萨克斯手查理· 帕克共同创立。比波普和摇摆乐最主要的区别是比波普演奏者参与即兴演奏，经常在第一个主题演奏之后就抛弃旋律，强调自由．富于冒险性．演奏速度非常快。又由于这种音乐风格的激进性，使其在出现不久之后就脱离了喜爱爵士乐和舞曲音乐的广大听众，虽大大提高了音乐的艺术性，但同时也削弱了商业价值。波普的发展为独奏和伴奏的乐手都开辟了新的天地，产生了许多新意，鼓手开始不再依恋Bass Drum,而开始大量运用Cymbal和Hi-hat.而Bass则担当低音节奏，演奏着近乎无视于人的游移四分音符低音旋律，维持着音乐的和弦进行。而钢琴手则不再过分强调左手的拍子和和弦基础音，而是喜欢用更轻的触键来演奏。这样，现代爵士的雏形就产生了。其代表乐手是Lester. Young和Coleman hawkins.

Bebop or bop is a style of jazz developed in the early to mid-1940s in the United States, which features songs characterized by a fast tempo, complex chord progressions with rapid chord changes and numerous changes of key, instrumental virtuosity, and improvisation based on a combination of harmonic structure, the use of scales and occasional references to the melody.

Bebop developed as the younger generation of jazz musicians expanded the creative possibilities of jazz beyond the popular, dance-oriented swing style with a new "musician's music" that was not as danceable and demanded close listening. As bebop was not intended for dancing, it enabled the musicians to play at faster tempos. Bebop musicians explored advanced harmonies, complex syncopation, altered chords, extended chords, chord substitutions, asymmetrical phrasing, and intricate melodies. Bebop groups used rhythm sections in a way that expanded their role. Whereas the key ensemble of the swing era was the big band of up to fourteen pieces playing in an ensemble-based style, the classic bebop group was a small combo that consisted of saxophone (alto or tenor), trumpet, piano, double bass, and drums playing music in which the ensemble played a supportive role for soloists. Rather than play heavily arranged music, bebop musicians typically played the melody of a song (called the "head") with the accompaniment of the rhythm section, followed by a section in which each of the performers improvised a solo, then returned to the melody at the end of the song.

Bop, or be-bop in its full name, was a young jazz man's answer to the more conservative prevailingly swing music of the time. Developed in New York City during the early 40s, bop hit the international scene in 1945 and took everyone by surprise with its energetic and radical approach to swing jazz music. In the hands of innovators such as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Bud Powell, the old swing music was given much faster tempos and more spare accompaniments from the rhythm section which opened up space for rapid fire pyrotechnical solos. Still a favorite genre in jazz music schools around the world, many clubs still feature be-bop to this day, but today's bop sounds tamer and calmer than the original item.

  ## Chamber Jazz 室内爵士

室内爵士是爵士乐流派的一种，深受新古典主义音乐与西洋音乐的古典形态影响，在有些国家也是受到传统凯尔特音乐，欧洲民间音乐，拉美音乐的影响而成型。

Chamber Jazz is distinguished by small, acoustic-based ensembles in which improvisation is a major factor. Though some groups are more jazz-based than others, they all tend to employ neoclassical aesthetics, particularly from the Impressionistic period and later 20th-century movements. Ethnic elements are also an important factor. These world-music leanings, however, are usually oriented toward the classical traditions of other cultures (Indian, Middle Eastern, and Asian), although South American styles also figure prominently in a lot of these recordings. -- Linda Kohanov

  ## Contemporary Jazz 当代爵士



  ## Cool Jazz 冷爵士

酷爵士乐(CoolJazz)一般而言指1949-1950年间，由小喇叭手迈尔士戴维斯(MilesDavis)所领导的九重奏为Capitol唱片公司灌录的专辑《BirthoftheCool》所代表的乐风，它的诞生使主流爵士乐风，从咆哮乐风的"热"，转向另一个反方向酷派乐风的"冷"，这是一种180度大逆转的历史性发展。酷派爵士乐代表一种内敛自省的情感，它是一种轻柔、清凉与抒情的含蓄情愫；它的音色不如一般铜管器那样亮丽夺目，取而代之的是柔和优美。若说咆哮乐是代表热情奔放，那么酷派爵士乐就是内敛自省。简而言之，酷派爵士乐是对咆哮乐的反抗与检讨，同时也唤醒美国西岸一些白人乐手的自觉运动，形成一股新兴的爵士乐潮流-西岸酷派爵士乐(WestCoastCoolJazz)。而酷派爵士最著名的作品，即是迈尔士戴维斯五重奏的「KINDOFBLUE」。因为这种乐风常被美国西海岸乐手使用，所以Cool Jazz也被称为西岸爵士乐(West Coast Jazz)，它可以说恰好是相对于比波普的风格而存在，相对于比波普的快速节拍、复杂的旋律、和弦、曲调，Cool Jazz会轻松很多。

1950年，Miles Davis九人小组推出的专辑《The Birth of The Cool》，标志着Cool爵士的产生。

Cool爵士选用的音调是轻柔的、淡雅的，音质柔和干爽。独奏中，带给你一种柔和舒缓、克制的感觉。其重奏部分微妙深奥，有时让你联想起欧州经典室内乐。Cool爵士虽然也揉进了Bop的音调、旋律与和声的优势，但是比Bop的即兴演奏更舒缓平滑，音色更加和谐，与Bop相比，Cool爵士乐经常突出体现一种松弛感，而没有Bop那么强的内在张力。

Cool爵士鼓手也更加安静，不干扰其他音色，总而言之，Cool爵士风格是节制的，“点到为止”，这正是为什么其乐迷称之为“Cool”的原因。

Cool jazz is a style of modern jazz music that arose in the United States after World War II. It is characterized by relaxed tempos and lighter tone, in contrast to the fast and complex bebop style. Cool jazz often employs formal arrangements and incorporates elements of classical music. Broadly, the genre refers to a number of post-war jazz styles employing a more subdued approach than that found in other contemporaneous jazz idioms. As Paul Tanner, Maurice Gerow, and David Megill suggest "the tonal sonorities of these conservative players could be compared to pastel colors, while the solos of [Dizzy] Gillespie and his followers could be compared to fiery red colors."
Cool Jazz evolved directly from bop in the late '40s and '50s. Essentially, it was a mixture of bop with certain aspects of swing that had been overlooked or temporarily discarded. Dissonances were smoothed out, tones were softened, arrangements became important again, and the rhythm section's accents were less jarring. Because some of the key pacesetters of the style (many of whom were studio musicians) were centered in Los Angeles, it was nicknamed "West Coast jazz." Some of the recordings were experimental in nature (hinting at classical music) and some overarranged sessions were bland, but in general this was a viable and popular style. By the late '50s, hard bop from the East Coast had succeeded cool jazz, although many of the style's top players had long and productive careers. Among the many top artists who were important in the development of cool jazz were Lester Young,Miles Davis, Gerry Mulligan, Stan Getz, Shorty Rogers, and Howard Rumsey (leader of the Lighthouse All-Stars). -- Scott Yanow
Cool jazz arose slowly in the late 40s when many jazz musicians realised there was no point in following in the fast paced be-bop footsteps of Diz and Bird and began to try a more relaxed and quieter approach to playing. Early examples of cool jazz came from Miles Davis' Nonet and Lenny Tristano's group, while later practitioners like Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker showed up on the west coast where cool jazz was often referred to as west coast jazz.

Many cool jazz saxophonists looked to the pre-bop languid sax style of Lester Young for inspiration. Also, 3rd Stream influenced arrangements that featured Baroque style counterpoint became popular during the cool era. One lasting innovation of the cool genre is the idea of concert hall influenced 'chamber jazz' as pioneered by The Modern Jazz Quartet. For some critics, west coast jazz seemed like a souless sell-out compared to the more challenging and urban flavored be-bop of New York City. In 1952 Miles Davis was one of the first 'cool' band leaders to lead the way to a more aggressive next phase in jazz, hard bop.

Cool jazz began to fade before the arrival of fusion and never made a comeback afterwards. Today Cool Jazz is a retro style that defines a certain time and place in jazz history, but is still played by some.

  ## Dixieland 迪克西兰爵士

迪克西兰爵士乐是1917年到1923年在新奥尔良和芝加哥等地的爵士乐手发展出来的早期爵士乐风，它在30年代后期曾被一群拥护者重新找出来复兴一阵子。简单的说，迪克西兰爵士乐是新奥尔良传统爵士乐的一个分支，Dixieland的英文原意是军队露营之地——“Dixie's Land”。这个字第一次出现在1859年Dan Emmett 先生的“殖民地歌曲与舞蹈”歌册中，因此，我们可以得知：迪克西兰爵士乐与进行曲、江湖卖唱艺人（Minstrels）等音乐有关，其第一首知名曲子是1860年出版的“Pocahontas”。到了1910年代，吹这种风格的爵士乐队己被衍化为小型团体，取材大半来自蓝调、进行曲与当时的流行歌曲，甚至某首乐曲的某一小段（Rags）都可以被拿来加以延伸、推展，这是即兴演奏的滥觞。迪克西兰爵士乐的主旋律一般都由小喇叭、竖笛或伸缩喇叭担任，而伴奏乐器是以钢琴、吉他、斑鸠琴、土巴号、贝斯或鼓为主。
Dixieland, sometimes referred to as hot jazz or traditional jazz, is a style of jazz based on the music that developed in New Orleans at the start of the 20th century.

One of the first uses of the term "Dixieland" with reference to music was in the name of the Original Dixieland Jass Band (which shortly thereafter changed the spelling of its name to "Original Dixieland Jazz Band"). Their 1917 recordings fostered popular awareness of this new style of music. At that time, there was no issue of subgenres of jazz, so "Dixieland" referred to the band and not the music. A revival movement for traditional jazz, formed in reaction to the orchestrated sounds of the swing era and the perceived chaos of the new bebop sounds of the 1940s (referred to as "Chinese music" by Louis Armstrong[citation needed]), pulled "Dixieland" out from the somewhat forgotten band's name for the music they championed. The revival movement included elements of the Chicago style that developed during the 1920s, such as the use of a string bass instead of a tuba, and chordal instruments, in addition to the original format of the New Orleans style. That reflected the fact that virtually all of the recorded repertoire of New Orleans musicians was from the period when the format was already evolving beyond the traditional New Orleans format. "Dixieland" may in that sense be regarded as denoting the jazz revival movement of the late 1930s to the 1950s as much as any particular subgenre of jazz. The essential elements that were accepted as within the style were the traditional front lines consisting of trumpets, trombones, and clarinets, and ensemble improvisation over a 2-beat rhythm.
Dixieland started as a continuation of the original New Orleans jazz tradition (see New Orleans Jazz genre), but in a different locale and under different circumstances. During the early 1920s, many New Orleans musicians drifted up to Chicago seeking work where they continued their musical traditions, but no longer as marching bands. The more stationary aspect of these bands led to the addition of the piano to the band, while the stand up bass replaced the tuba.

The music also began to evolve as the musicians began to play with a faster more aggressive feel, and the rhythm section began to accent the 2 and 4 of the beat which led to the driving accented rhythms of RnB and rock-n-roll. Dixieland has had many revivals over the years, sometimes authentic and sometimes corny and amateur. To this day you can still find bands all over the world that play this traditional form of jazz.

  ## Experimental Big Band 实验大乐队

早在六十年代，实验性大乐队开始融入自由爵士乐和即兴创作的元素，并在较小的先锋乐团和古典作曲家的作品的推动下，在接下来的几十年中扩大了他们的范围，尝试无固定调性的音乐，不和谐和日益复杂结构。从像Sun Ra Arkestra和Carla Bley这样的大乐队这样的团体开始，到Little Huey创作音乐管弦乐队的全面混乱，实验大乐队在大型团体编制中产生了惊人的多样化声音。

Experimental big bands began to incorporate elements of free jazz and improvisation as early as the '60s, and fueled by the work of smaller avant-garde ensembles and classical composers, increased their scope in the following decades to embrace atonal music, discordance and increasingly complex structures. From the post-bop beginnings of groups like the Sun Ra Arkestra and Carla Bley's big band, to the full-on chaos of the Little Huey Creative Music Orchestra, experimental big bands produce an amazing diversity of sounds within the large group format.

  ## Free Jazz 自由爵士

自由爵士产生于60年代，这种全新的音乐刚一出现，就深受广大爵士音乐家和爵士乐迷的喜爱。
自由爵士不同于以往爵士乐，在和声、旋律方面没有太多的限制，演奏者在演奏过程中可以自由、大胆、随心所欲的发挥。自由爵士具有全新的节奏概念，节拍、对称性被统统打乱，同时，它也强调音乐本身的强度与张力，加入大量的不谐和音，把非洲、印度、日本、及阿拉伯等不同的音乐融合到了一起，采用了印度的西塔尔琴、塔布拉双鼓、扩音拇指钢琴、警笛和大量的电子设备及打击乐器，因此，有些自由爵士乐队看上去就象一支非爵士的先锋派乐队。
自由爵士乐对60代爵士乐的发展起到了深远的影响。

Dixieland and swing stylists improvise melodically, and bop, cool, and hard bop players follow chord structures in their solos. Free Jazz was a radical departure from past styles, for typically after playing a quick theme, the soloist does not have to follow any progression or structure and can go in any unpredictable direction. When Ornette Coleman largely introduced free jazz to New York audiences (although Cecil Taylor had preceded him with less publicity), many bop musicians and fans debated about whether what was being played would even qualify as music; the radicals had become conservatives in less than 15 years. Free jazz, which overlaps with the avant garde (the latter can use arrangements and sometimes fairly tight frameworks), remains a controversial and mostly underground style, influencing the modern mainstream while often being ignored. Having dispensed with many of the rules as far as pitch, rhythm, and development are concerned (although it need not be atonal or lack a steady pulse to be free jazz), the success of a free jazz performance can be measured by the musicianship and imagination of the performers, how colorful the music is, and whether it seems logical or merely random.

  ## Gypsy Jazz 吉普赛爵士

吉普赛爵士（或称摇摆吉普赛爵士）是一种爵士乐演奏风格，多数人认为由金格·莱恩哈特 （Django Reinhardt）于1930年期间开创了这种乐风。吉普赛爵士的发迹与法国息息相关，许多人也称其为"Jazz Manouche"（译为吉普赛爵士），即便在英文里也是这样称呼。这个词现在普遍指称这种音乐风格。

金格被认为是1930年到1950年间，活跃于巴黎的罗姆吉他四重奏中的灵魂人物，这个四人乐团由金格、Baro兄弟和金格的兄弟约瑟夫·莱恩哈特（Joseph Reinhardt）组成。

许多这种乐风的演奏家，同时也是当时著名的马赛特乐团中的一员。马赛特风格的华尔滋对吉普赛爵士影响深远。 金格将大量暗悔的半音阶与当时的摇摆乐结合，成为他的个人特色。 这样的结合使吉普赛爵士备受讨论。 此外，金格的演奏手法更奠定了现代吉普赛爵士吉他的基础。 金格所属最著名的爵士乐团Quintette du Hot Club de France ，也让爵士小提琴手Stéphane Grappelli闻名于世。

Quintette du Hot Club de France最初没有鼓手，并以木吉他作为主导乐器。吉他和小提琴是主要的独奏乐器，不过单簧管、 曼陀林和手风琴也常在独奏中出现，并用节奏吉他特别的节奏手法"la pompe"来取代爵士鼓。大多数的吉普赛爵士吉他手，无论是主奏或节奏吉他手，都使用为金格量身定做的Selmer-Maccaferri吉他。

吉普赛爵士的乐团，通常由主奏吉他、小提琴、两个节奏吉他和贝斯组成。不管是大型的现场演出，小型的非正式即兴演出，或如每年在法国北部的萨穆瓦叙尔塞纳举办的「金格·莱恩哈特音乐节」中演出的乐团，都忠于乐器原音的呈现。

东方的吉普赛爵士乐中，节奏部的乐器通常是一或两个辛巴龙（一种匈牙利乐器），或一个辛巴龙加上一把木吉他，可能再加上一组爵士鼓，并由低音提琴当作基底。

Gypsy jazz (also known as gypsy swing or hot club jazz) is a style of jazz music generally accepted to have been started by the gypsy guitarist Jean "Django" Reinhardt in and around Paris in the 1930s. Because its origins are in France and Django was from the Manouche Roma clan (although his frequent accompanists, and later solo performers/band leaders the Ferret brothers were not Manouches but Gitan Roma) it is often called by the French name, "jazz manouche", or alternatively, "manouche jazz", even in English language sources. The term is now commonly used for this style of music.

Rhythm guitar in gypsy jazz uses a special form of strumming known as "la pompe", i.e. "the pump". This form of percussive rhythm is similar to the "boom-chick" in bluegrass styles; it is what gives the music its fast swinging feeling, and it most often emphasizes beats two and four; a vital feature of swing. The strumming hand, which never touches the top of the guitar, must make a quick up-down strum followed by a down strum. The up-down part of la pompe must be done extremely fast, regardless of the tempo of the music. It is very similar to a grace note in classical music, albeit an entire chord is used. This pattern is usually played in unison by two or more guitarists in the rhythm section.

Another important aspect of this style of playing is based on the chord shapes Django was forced to use due to his injury. Standard barre chords are not as common in gypsy jazz. Standard major and minor chords are almost never played, and are instead replaced by major 7th chords, major 6th chords, and 6/9 chords. Gypsy reharmonisation is often aimed at giving a minor feel even where a song is in a major key, for instance the substitution of a minor 6th chord for a dominant seventh. Dominant seventh chords are also altered by lowering the 9th and 13th scale degree.

Gypsy jazz has its own set of frequently played standards, which are fairly distinct from the standards tunes of mainstream jazz. However, contemporary ensembles may adapt almost any type of song to the style.

Gypsy swing standards include jazz hits of the '20s and '30s, such as "Limehouse Blues", and "Dinah"; Bal Musette numbers, often waltzes; original compositions by Django Reinhardt, such as "Nuages" and "Swing 42"; compositions by other notable gypsy swing players; and jazzed-up versions of gypsy songs, such as "Dark Eyes".

Much of the repertoire is in minor keys, and the dorian and harmonic minor modes are frequently heard, lending a distinctively dark and modal sound to the tunes which contrasts with the uptempo and spirited performance style. One popular example is Django's tune "Minor Swing", perhaps the most well-known gypsy jazz composition. Slower ballads and duets may feature rubato playing and exotic harmonies.

  ## Hard Bop 硬波普

产生于50年代，是比波普的延伸和与Cool Jazz相对的乐风。它一方面延伸了比波普节奏上的特点，但旋律却更多采用了蓝调和福音歌曲的因素，旋律比特别强调技巧的Bebop要来得轻松。
硬波普的发展是波普爵士乐发展的必然，是波普爵士乐的一种延伸的形式。两者的主要不同是，硬波普的节奏相对更为简化，更体现灵歌的风格，节奏部乐器的演奏，主要是贝司的演奏相对松散的多，不像波普爵士乐的演奏那样相对严格遵循四拍一小节的固定节奏。福音音乐对于硬波普爵士乐的影响更为明显，钢琴和萨克斯的演奏很像早期的节奏布鲁斯音乐的风格。尽管硬波普爵士乐鼎盛时期相对波普爵士乐来说更长（从1955年到1970年），两者的区别很大程度上反映出两者的逻辑演变过程，硬波普爵士乐可以看作是波普爵士乐在五、六十年代的形式。到了六十年代的后期，在一些硬波普爵士乐音乐家的演奏中可以感觉到前卫爵士乐的影响。
Hard bop is a subgenre of jazz that is an extension of bebop (or "bop") music. Journalists and record companies began using the term in the mid-1950s to describe a new current within jazz which incorporated influences from rhythm and blues, gospel music, and blues, especially in saxophone and piano playing.
Hard bop is sometimes referred to as "funky hard bop." The "funky" label refers to the rollicking, rhythmic feeling associated with the style. The descriptor is also used to describe soul jazz, which is commonly associated with hard bop. According to Mark C. Gridley, soul jazz more specifically refers to music with "an earthy, bluesy melodic concept and... repetitive, dance-like rhythms.... Note that some listeners make no distinction between 'soul-jazz' and 'funky hard bop,' and many musicians don't consider 'soul-jazz' to be continuous with 'hard bop.'" The term "soul" suggests the church, and traditional gospel music elements such as "amen chords" (the plagal cadence) and triadic harmonies that seemed to suddenly appear in jazz during the era.

Cool jazz's reign as the prevalent jazz style after bop's demise was short lived as many jazz players, especially on the east coast, wanted to return to a style of jazz that had a little more grit and aggression. Hard bop was a return to some of the ascetics of bop, but also offered some new differences. Hard bop brought back the faster tempos of the bop era, but in hard bop the harmonic changes did not come in such rapid fire succession and musicians found themselves stretching out on longer modal style solos. The new emphasis on albums rather than singles also led to longer songs. Hard bop players also began to bring more influences from the church, blues and RnB into jazz which foreshadowed the coming of soul jazz. Despite an influx of avant-garde jazz in the 60s, hard bop remained the prevalent jazz style until the emergence of fusion in the late 60s. Hard bop has enjoyed many revivals over the years and remains one of the most enduring and popular styles in jazz. Miles Davis is considered an early innovator in the field of hard bop, but Art Blakey and the many musicians who played in his Jazz Messengers are considered to be the epitome of the style.

Although some history books claim that Hard Bop arose as a reaction to the softer sounds featured in cool jazz, it was actually an extension of bop that largely ignored West Coast jazz. The main differences between hard bop and bop are that the melodies tend to be simpler and often more "soulful"; the rhythm section is usually looser, with the bassist not as tightly confined to playing four-beats-to-the-bar as in bop; a gospel influence is felt in some of the music; and quite often, the saxophonists and pianists sound as if they were quite familiar with early rhythm & blues. Since the prime time period of hard bop (1955-70) was a decade later than bop, these differences were a logical evolution and one can think of hard bop as bop of the '50s and '60s. By the second half of the 1960s, the influence of the avant garde was being felt and some of the more adventurous performances of the hard bop stylists (such as Jackie McLean and Lee Morgan) fell somewhere between the two styles. With the rise of fusion and the sale of Blue Note(hard bop's top label) in the late '60s, the style fell on hard times although it was revived to a certain extent in the 1980s. Much of the music performed by the so-called Young Lions during the latter decade (due to other influences altering their style) was considered modern mainstream, although some groups (such as the Harper Brothers and T.S. Monk's sextet) have kept the 1960s' idiom alive. -- Scott Yanow

  ## Mainstream Jazz 主流爵士

主流爵士其实是爵士乐的一位评论家斯坦利．丹斯创造的，他在描述五十年代的小号演奏家巴克．克莱顿和他同期音乐家的演奏时首次使用了这个词。这些音乐家大多都是摇摆乐时代的资深音乐家，他们并不是使他们的风格现代化，并不演奏波普爵士乐，或是加入五十年代重新兴起的迪克西兰乐队，从前的大乐队时代的明星们以小乐队的形式演奏昔日的标准曲，并获得巨大的成功。

在20世纪50年代斯坦利．丹斯定义了主流爵士之后，定义随着爵士音乐的演变和发展而改变。 那么以前主流的东西现在不会被认为是主流。从一般意义上讲，主流爵士乐可以被认为是当时最受欢迎的节目：例如，在摇摆乐时代 ，摇摆乐和大乐队音乐处于巅峰期，目标则是受众正在关注的音乐类型。 虽然Bebop在那段时间被引入爵士乐，但那时候的观众并没有对它有所了解。

Mainstream jazz is a term that was first established in the 1950s by music journalist Stanley Dance. At that time, Dance considered "Mainstream" anything within the popular jazz music of the Swing Era.[1] Another way to describe Mainstream Jazz in the 1950s was music that did not incorporate the bebop style.

After Dance defined Mainstream Jazz in the 1950s, the definition changed with the evolution and progression of jazz music. What was mainstream then would not be considered mainstream now. In a general sense, Mainstream Jazz can be considered what was most popular at the time: For example, during the Swing era, swing and big band music were in their prime and what target audiences were looking for. Although Bebop was introduced into jazz during that time, audiences had not developed an ear for it.

  ## Modal Jazz 调式爵士

调式爵士（Modal jazz）是爵士乐的一种，在和声架构方面采用调式而非进行式和弦。调式爵士乐发源于20世纪50年代末和60年代，最典型的代表是迈尔士·戴维斯的专辑《Milstones》（1958）、专辑《Kind of Blue》（1959）和1960至1964年约翰·柯川的古典四人组。其他重要的表演者包括比尔·艾文斯、贺比·汉考克、Wayne Shorter和McCoy Tyner。该名称原先源于在独奏时使用调式的不同音高，但此种音乐形式的作品或伴奏还可以有如下特点：

缓慢的和声节奏，一个和弦可以长达四至十六甚至更多个小节；
持续低音和反复；
没有或较少有全音阶功能性的进行式和弦；
四度音程的和声或旋律。

Modal jazz is jazz that uses musical modes rather than chord progressions as a harmonic framework. Though earlier precedents exist, modal jazz was crystallized as a distinct theory by composer George Russell in his 1953 book Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization.

Particularly popular in the 1950s and 1960s, modal jazz is epitomized by Miles Davis's 1958 composition "Milestones", 1959 album Kind of Blue, and John Coltrane's classic quartet from 1960–64,both of which were directly inspired by Russell.Other important performers include Woody Shaw, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, McCoy Tyner, Larry Young, Pharoah Sanders, Joe Henderson, Chick Corea and Bobby Hutcherson.Though the term comes from the use of the pitches of particular modes (or scales) in the creation of solos, modal jazz compositions or accompaniments may only or additionally make use of the following techniques

slow-moving harmonic rhythm, where single chords may last four to sixteen or more measures
pedal points and drones
absent or suppressed standard functional chord progressions
quartal harmonies or melodies
polytonality

  ## New Orleans Jazz 新奥尔良爵士

新奥尔良爵士是指三十年代（指二十世纪，下文中如未作注明均指二十世纪）以前的传统爵士乐，兴起于新奥尔良，盛行于芝加哥，是迪克西兰爵士（Dixieland Jazz）和芝加哥爵士（Chicago Jazz）的总称。我们所能听到的最早的爵士乐就是新奥尔良爵士，它出现于1917年（第一张爵士乐唱片诞生于1917年）。从唱片的音质上辨认，这个时期的唱片大多数都是用留声机播放的密纹唱片，音质较差，带有沙沙的噪声，并且缺乏立体感（第一批立体声唱片诞生于1958年）。从音乐形象上辨认，新奥尔良爵士讲究合奏，给人的感觉是激烈、兴奋并充满生机的。乐队编制一般为小号（或短号）一至二人吹奏主旋律，单簧管一人吹奏副旋律，长号一人吹奏固定低音，贝司（或大管）、鼓各一人担任节奏。后来又增加了萨克斯，使其从此成为爵士乐队的一大特色。新奥尔良爵士作为最早的传统爵士乐已被历史永久记载，但是作为有声爵士乐的源头，如今听起来还是别具一番风味。

新奥尔良爵士乐（New Orleans Jazz）是爵士乐最早的音乐风格。新奥尔良爵士讲究合奏，给人的感觉是激烈、兴奋并充满生机的。乐队编制一般为小号（或短号）一至二人吹奏主旋律，单簧管一人吹奏副旋律，长号一人吹奏固定低音贝司（或大管）、鼓各一人担任节奏。后来又增加了萨克斯，使其从此成为爵士乐队的一大特色。大致是从1895年当巴迪·博尔登在新奥尔良组建自己的第一支乐队时开始这种音乐就在新奥尔良演奏，直到1917年斯托瑞维尔俱乐部不幸关闭为止。由于新奥尔良爵士乐强调合奏，因此每一件乐器在乐队中的角色都受到了严格的限制，通常，小号和短号是乐队中的重要角色，常常演奏旋律部分，而长号则是和昔的主要来源，副部则通常由短号演奏。节奏部相对稳定，通常包括了钢琴，圆号，贝司和鼓，这种音乐同早期的行进乐队有直接的渊源。由于这种音乐相对来说，和音较为基本，合奏通常表现欢乐的主题，因此一直是爵士乐中最为欢快和容易接受的风格。

The genre New Orleans Jazz refers to jazz in its earliest forms. In the late 19th century New Orleans brass bands would perform in marches, parades and funerals playing anything from military tunes to rags in a polyphonic style similar to African-American vocal music. Since many of these marches were very lengthy, the tunes would have to be repeated many times leading the performers to improvise on the melodies to relieve their boredom.

Typical New Orleans bands in this era had a front line of coronet, clarinet and trombone, while the rhythm section was composed of banjo, tuba and a percussionist. The coronet would play the melody while the clarinet would improvise counter melodies and the trombone supplied pedal points that pointed out harmonic changes while the tuba covered the bass. Improvisation would take place in a similar counter-point style with no one member being a featured soloist. The rhythm sections in early New Orleans bands would place the accent on every beat. Later the Chicago Dixieland musicians would place the accent on 2 and 4, which eventually led to the creation of RnB and rock-n-roll. Unfortunately there are no recordings of early jazz bands because the first recording of a jazz band didn't take place until 1917.

The earliest style of jazz, the music played in New Orleans from about the time that Buddy Bolden formed his first band in 1895 untilStoryville was closed in 1917, unfortunately went totally unrecorded. However with the success of the Original Dixieland Jazz Bandin 1917 and the many performances documented in the 1920s, it became possible to hear what this music sounded like in later years. Ensemble-oriented with fairly strict roles for each instrument, New Orleans Jazz generally features a trumpet or cornet providing a melodic lead, harmonies from the trombone, countermelodies by the clarinet, and a steady rhythm stated by the rhythm section (which usually consists of piano, banjo or guitar, tuba, or bass and drums). This music is a direct descendant of marching brass bands and, although overlapping with Dixieland, tends to de-emphasize solos in favor of ensembles featuring everyone playing and improvising together. Due to its fairly basic harmonies and the pure joy of the ensembles, it is consistently the happiest and most accessible style of jazz. -- Scott Yanow

  ## Nu Jazz 电爵士

NUJAZZ（新兴爵士）：爵士面新的型态，融合电子音乐为主，也就是所谓的Nu-Jazz。Nu Jazz于90年代后期形成，是一种将Jazz架构或是Jazz演奏透过电子手法表现出的一种音乐,有时称之为电子爵士Electro Jazz或者Jazz House等等），但Nu Jazz并无较明确的模式，有时候可能运用真实乐器演奏，有时透过电子手法来表现21世纪的爵士风貌，有时艺人们（或是DJS）又会给JAZZ加入不同类型的音乐元素,例如:funk, Soul, electronic dance和一些即兴创作等等。使JAZZ乐变得多元化，所以NU-JAZZ（NU JAZZ）有时候可分做electronic jazz, electro-jazz, e-jazz,jazztronica, jazz house, phusion, "neo-jazz" ,future jazz.例如像是来自法国的St.German和来自德国的Jazznova等，都是当时NUJAZZ领域中的佼佼者。Nu Jazz基本上比起它的表亲Acid Jazz更朝电子领域延伸，不管它是加入了Hip Hop，House，Drum & Bass或是Broken beat等节奏元素，但基本调性仍然离不开Jazz架构。
Nu jazz, also known as jazztronica, is a genre of jazz and contemporary electronic music. The term was coined in the late 1990s to refer to music that blends jazz elements with other musical styles, such as funk, soul, electronic music, and free improvisation.
Nu jazz grew out of the combined influences of Jon Hassel’s Kiranic trumpet playing and ‘fourth world’ rhythms, Miles Davis’ soft tone and use of ambience on “In a Silent Way”, and the early 90s intersection of jazz and electronica, particularly trip-hop, dub and down-tempo. Some early Nu Jazz artists include Nils Petter Molvaer and Bugge Wesseltoft. Over time, other influences were introduced to the Nu Jazz sound.

For a time, the jangling ambient guitar sound of post-rock was a big influence on Nu Jazz, but that has mostly faded now. Meanwhile, bands like Jagga Jazzist and Snarky Puppy have re-discovered the lush orchestrations of sophisticated easy listening and exotica arrangers such as Henry Mancini and Les Baxter. Yet another influence, one that has emerged from the sound of the popular Portico Quartet and others, is the use of repeating minimalist phrases. This use of short repeating melodic phrases not only comes from minimalist composers such as Steve Reich and Phillip Glass, but also from Zeuhl artists and a long history of European art rock. An influence from ambient music is also part of the Nu Jazz genre, this can be found in the early music of Nils Petter Molvaer, as well as others. Nick Bartsch is a popular Nu Jazz artist who often combines the repeating figures of minimalism with a dub reggae style ambiance.

All of the above mentioned influences may appear on a Nu Jazz album, but not necessarily all. As Nu Jazz continues to develop, the most constant factors tend be a relaxed 'cool' approach, an influence from modern electronica and an appreciation for ironic kitsch and retro sounds. Some early precedents for Nu Jazz can found in the Terry Riley influenced ambient sections on Soft Machine's IIIrd album, Brian Eno's use of Brand X's funk/fusion backing tracks in building his late 70s ambient art rock albums, and Miles Davis' lengthy "He Loved Him Madly" from his "Get Up With It" album.

Although there are musical differences between Nu Jazz and Contemporary Jazz, from a pop-culture standpoint, the more obvious difference between the two is Nu Jazz’s self-aware ’hipster’ stance, compared to Contemporary Jazz’s more emotionally earnest approach.

  ## Post-Bop 后波普

后波普也叫新波普，将摇滚乐、节奏布鲁斯以及流行音乐引入爵士乐,并在演奏中加入电子合成乐器。

Post-bop is a genre of small-combo jazz that evolved in the early to mid-1960s. Post-bop is jazz from the mid-1960s onward that assimilates hard bop, modal jazz, avant-garde and free jazz without necessarily being immediately identifiable as any of the above.[citation needed] Post-bop can refer to a variety of Jazz music that is post-bebop chronologically but in the common understanding post-bop music reflects these influences: the more open approach to the jazz ensemble crystallized by the second Miles Davis quintet, and the modal intensity of that group as well as of the classic John Coltrane Quartet.

According to musicologist Jeremy Yudkin, post-bop does not follow "the conventions of bop or the apparently formless freedom of the new jazz".
Post Bop is a modern jazz style that continues the distinguishing characteristics that separate jazz from the world of pop and rock; swing rhythm and extended harmonies (9th chords 11ths, altered chords, etc). Post Bop grew out of the Hard Bop genre during the early to mid 60s as musicians such as Bill Evans, Wayne Shorter, and Herbie Hancock began to introduce more extended harmonies, abstract structures and looser rhythms in their playing and compositions. When Hancock and Shorter joined Miles Davis’ quintet in the mid-60s, that group became the perfect vehicle for extending the boundaries of what could happen in a Post Bop format. The Miles Davis Quintet albums, "Nefertiti" and "Sorcer", continue to be pinnacles of Post Bop composition and performance. Some styles of free modal jazz, such as Coltrane's "A Love Supreme", are also part of the Post Bop sound. Although there are still some musicians, such as Kenny Garret, who play in that style, mostly that sound has been fading since the early 70s.

While still in its infancy, Post Bop was pushed off the radar during the 70s as many of its early proponents pursued the far more lucrative fields of fusion and smooth jazz. As the fusion fad began to fade, musicians began to tire of three chord vamps and the limitations of rock/pop rhythms and yearned to work with sophisticated chord changes and jazz rhythms again. The stage was set in the early 80s for the “young lion” movement and a return to both Post Bop and Hard Bop for a lot of young musicians and their fan base.

Today’s Post Bop covers a wide variety, from radio friendly to borderline avant-garde, and it’s a genre that is still ripe for more exploration. Generally speaking, the difference between Post Bop and Hard Bop is that Hard Bop carries a stronger trace of the blues and a more straight forward driving rhythm, but when you are trying to analyze certain artists or pieces of music, that difference is not always clear. Much of Branford Marsalis's music is a good example of jazz that sits right between post and hard bop. With some music, arguing whether it is Post Bop or Hard Bop becomes pointless, since depending on perspective, either genre can be seen as a subset of the other. Although we use the genre term Post Bop to tag the music described above, in a more generic sense, post bop can be the name of any swing based jazz music created after the passing of the be-bop era.

Part 2 - Post Bop in the New Century

As jazz continues to grow and develop, the worlds of modern fusion and post bop have grown closer together as many musicians; such as Dave Douglas, Craig Taborn, Greg Osby and others, freely mix elements into new hybrids.

At JMA, the distinction between Fusion and Post Bop continues to be that distinctive African syncopation known as "swing". Generally Post Bop should swing, while Fusion, quite often does not. What has changed, as we move further into the 21st century, is the way in which modern drummers are 'swinging'. Inventive drummers such as Jeff "Tain" Watts, Rudy Roystan and others are no longer putting the swing beat solely on the ride cymbal. Instead, they are liable to use any, or all pieces of the drum set at once, while they swing the beat. Also, the swing feel itself is often a bit disguised in modern jazz, it may not be so obvious, and the drummer may move in and out of swing feel, sometimes even within one phrase.

  ## Ragtime 拉格泰姆

Regtime（拉格泰姆）爵士乐融合了欧洲古典音乐和欧洲军乐的特点而产生的。他打乱了古典音乐中严格的节拍规律，有演奏者掌握节奏的迟缓。乐曲的进行通常是起奏延缓，随即强调音节，这种风格在当时的钢琴演奏中极为常见。Regtime爵士乐在二十世纪出的十五年中非常盛行，虽然这种风格对爵士乐的形式具有非常重大的影响但是因为它缺乏Blues的感觉和没有即兴感觉，所以并不能称之为真正的爵士乐，但却是爵士乐发展中一种重要的音乐型态，以直立式钢琴演奏完全写谱的音乐，并强调切分音，风格略为呆板。

Ragtime是一种采用黑人旋律，依切分音法(Syncopation)循环主题与变形乐句等法则，结合而成的早期爵士乐，盛行於第一次世界大战前後。其发源与圣路易斯与纽奥尔良，而後美国的南方和中西部开始流行，它影响了纽奥尔良传统爵士乐的独奏与即兴演奏风格。繁音拍子後来发展成结合流行音乐、进行曲、华尔兹与其他流行舞蹈的型式，因此繁音拍子的歌曲、乐器管弦乐队编制的曲目陆续出现，它不但在黑人乐手与乐迷间流行，也被美国白人中产阶级所接受。Ragtime – also spelled rag-time or rag time – is a musical style that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or "ragged", rhythm.
Technically Ragtime isn't really jazz because it does not involve improvisation, but ragtime ran a parallel career to the early New Orleans jazz and featured similar melodies and rhythms. A simple way to look at ragtime is to consider it as a form of composed jazz, or possibly America's first classical music. Likewise, in a style similar to classical music, ragtime's rhythmic syncopations don't swing quite to the degree that they do in New Orleans jazz performance. Although ragtime first appeared in 1892, Scott Joplin would begin to dominate and define the genre in 1895.

The Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz opens with back to back renditions of Maple Leaf Rag by ragtime pianist Scott Joplin and early jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton. In these two performances of this same piece you can clearly hear the difference between ragtime and jazz as Morton's version swings with free abandon, while Joplin's stricter version is more similar to the European late romantic period style of Chopin.
Although lacking the improvisation or the blues feeling inherent in jazz, Ragtime was a strong influence on the earlier forms of jazz. At its prime from 1899-1915, ragtime is best known as totally written out piano music, though it was also performed by orchestras. Its syncopations and structure (blending together aspects of classical music and marches) hinted strongly at jazz, and many of its melodies (most notably "Maple Leaf Rag") would be played in later years by jazz musicians in a Dixieland context. -- Scott Yanow

  ## Skiffle 噪音爵士

噪音爵士乐（Skiffle）又称民谣爵士乐，是一种流行音乐，受到爵士乐、蓝调、民间音乐、美国民间音乐的影响，通常是一个小乐团，早期表演者经常使用自制或临时拼凑的乐器，比较著重于即兴演出。噪音爵士乐这个词起源于美国20世纪初期，在50年代英国开始流行，主要音乐家有Lonnie Donegan，The Vipers Skiffle Group，Ken Colyer和Chas McDevitt等。噪音爵士乐后来在许多杰出的爵士乐，流行乐，蓝调，民谣和摇滚音乐家的职业生涯中起到了重要作用，并被视为是英国民间复兴，英国蓝调热潮和英国入侵美国流行音乐界第二个关键的垫脚石。


Skiffle is a music genre with jazz, blues, folk and American folk influences, usually using a combination of manufactured and homemade or improvised instruments. Originating as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was associated with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, The Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer and Chas McDevitt. Skiffle played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians and has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, blues boom and British Invasion of the US popular music scene.

  ## Soul Jazz 灵魂爵士

灵魂爵士乐（Soul Jazz)也被叫做疯克爵士乐。是1960年代最流行的爵士风格。它从硬波普中发展而来。但是与比波普和硬波普之间还是有区别的。灵魂爵士 将重点放在了节奏模式(Rhytmic Groove)上。它通常是由一些小型乐队所演奏。尤其是由一名高音（中音）萨克斯风手 ，或钢琴手，又或口琴手带领的三人乐队。灵魂爵士是和酷爵士对立产生的。那时酷爵士正当流行。前者有着后者所没有的一切：充满热情，大汗淋漓而且从不离开它那布鲁斯的根源。比如快节奏的灵魂爵士作品旋律明快，层次分明，并伴以强烈的敲击舞曲节奏。抒情的的灵魂爵士歌曲就更离不开布鲁斯。
Soul jazz is a development of jazz incorporating strong influences from blues, soul, gospel and rhythm and blues in music for small groups, often an organ trio featuring a Hammond organ.
Soul jazz is a subset of the hard bop genre and carries the hard bop tendency towards RnB and blues just a bit further. It was the original intention of JMA to list the soul jazz artists in hard bop, but the line was drawn at the bluesy B3 organ players such as Groove Holmes and Jack McDuff. Put simply, soul jazz is instrumental RnB or blues with a swing or funk beat topped with virtuoso jazz solos. You can also find soul jazz artists on JMA in the hard bop, funk jazz, and acid jazz genres.

Soul-Jazz, which was the most popular jazz style of the 1960s, differs from bebop and hard bop (from which it originally developed) in that the emphasis is on the rhythmic groove. Although soloists follow the chords as in bop, the basslines (often played by an organist if not a string bassist) dance rather than stick strictly to a four-to-the bar walking pattern. The musicians build their accompaniment around the bassline and, although there are often strong melodies, it is the catchiness of the groove and the amount of heat generated by the soloists that determine whether the performance is successful. Soul-jazz's roots trace back to pianist Horace Silver, whose funky style infused bop with the influence of church and gospel music, along with the blues. Other pianists who followed and used similar approaches were Bobby Timmons, Junior Mance, Les McCann, Gene Harris (with his Three Sounds), andRamsey Lewis. With the emergence of organist Jimmy Smith in 1956 (who has dominated his instrument ever since), soul-jazz organ combos (usually also including a tenor, guitarist, drummer, and an occasional bassist) caught on, and soulful players became stars, including Brother Jack McDuff, Shirley Scott, Jimmy McGriff, Charles Earland, and Richard "Groove" Holmes, along with such other musicians as guitarists Grant Green, George Benson and Kenny Burrell; tenors Stanley Turrentine, Willis "Gator" Jackson, Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis, David "Fathead" Newman, Gene "Jug" Ammons, Houston Person, Jimmy Forrest, King Curtis, Red Holloway, and Eddie Harris; and altoist Hank Crawford. Despite its eclipse by fusion and synthesizers in the 1970s, soul-jazz has stayed alive and made a healthy comeback in recent years. — Scott Yanow

  ## Stride Piano 爵士钢琴



  ## Third Stream 第三流派

第三流派爵士乐这个说法是1957年由作曲家冈瑟．舒勒最先提出的。这种称呼的意义主要是指这种风格的爵士乐是爵士乐和古典音乐的混合体，是这两种重要的音乐形式之外的一种音乐。这种风格的最大的特点是将爵士乐和古典音乐成功地融合在一起，在演奏中大量地采用弦乐并减低了独奏在爵士乐中的重要地位。这并非是冈瑟．舒勒的独创，早在二十年代，著名的音乐指挥和作曲家保罗．惠特曼就曾尝试在古典爵士乐的独奏和管弦乐队的弦乐部分之间找到结合点。正像他所说，他想在“爵士乐中制造出二位贵妇人”。在四十年代时，弦乐的使用已经出现在爵士乐队的演奏中，如阿蒂．肖和斯坦．肯顿都曾进行过这类尝试。但是在所有的这些尝试中，弦乐似乎总是处于一个被动的地位，音乐家总是依照自己面前的乐谱演奏或是充当伴奏的角色。
从1949年起，Charlie Parker在自己的录音中加入了弦乐部的演奏。大约是在五十年代的中后期，更为严肃的实践才大量出现，舒勒，约翰．刘易斯和比尔．罗素是主要的作曲家，他们试图在古典音乐和爵士乐之间寻求沟通。在五十年代中期，大部分音乐预言家们都相信爵士乐的下一个发展阶段必然是一种与古典音乐的融合的形式。但是由于前卫派爵士乐的兴起，第三流派爵士乐运动宣告结束。最终这种风格只是在学院派预音乐家圈子里才能找到一些痕迹。

Third stream is a term coined by composer Gunther Schuller to desribe music that attempts to mix jazz with classical concert hall music. Jazz caught the ear of many composers in the early 20th century and soon Ravel, Debussy, Stravinsky and others began to put elements of American ragtime into their music. French composer Darius Milhaud furthered these experiments that culminated in George Gershwin's 'Blue Monday' and 'Rhapsody in Blue', two pieces which represented some of the first truly successful fusions of jazz and concert hall music.

From the jazz side of things, early attempts at classical influence came from Duke Ellington, Artie Shaw, Woody Herman, Bix Beiderbecke, James P. Johnson and others. Gunther Schuller and John Lewis' 'Third Stream Music', which combined a string quartet with a cool jazz combo, was one of the first entirely successful concert hall pieces by a jazz composer.

In today's music world, Third Stream often refers to compositions that have some element of jazz. At JMA, the Third Stream genre is also where you will find jazz or jazz related music that relies on composition more than improvisation.

Improvisation is generally seen as a vital component of Third Stream. In 1961, Schuller defined Third Stream as "a new genre of music located about halfway between jazz and classical music".

  ## Vocal Jazz 人声爵士

Vocal Jazz（人声爵士） 尽管并不是全部采用人声爵士，20世纪的人声爵士演绎大师大都采用爵士语言进行演奏。从Russ Columbo，Doris Day到Johnny Mathis均将其天才与嗓音用于内容的表达。他们放弃了爵士器乐演奏家惯用的演绎标准的方式，而利用其即兴演奏的天赋，音乐家的素养，甚至个性化，带给了歌词新的意义。早期的一对巨匠，Louis Armstrong，Bing Crosby，留下了人声爵士的标准：随意却不失焦点。几乎就是当时人声爵士的专业标准。从大乐队集中的地区涌现出了大批爵士演唱家，几乎都是后来的大师级人物：Frank Sinatra， Billie Holiday， Ella Fitzgerald， Anita ODay, Sarah Vaughan，Peggy Lee, Joe Williams；他们均和摇摆舞乐队共事过很长一段时间，多数在人声爵士风格开始时因此取得了巨大成功。尽管区分人声爵士演唱家与传统流行乐歌手并不总是那么容易，很多爵士节目单还是以演奏内容来作目录的。人声爵士与爵士独奏家们展开了竞争。他们那时通常拒绝与无名乐队和具有流行音乐元素的乐队合作。而选择与真正天赋禀异的组织者（Nelson Riddle, Billy May）以及真正伟大的作家合作（Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, the Gershwins）。和40, 50年代的人声爵士演唱家汲取了摇摆舞的风格一样，后波普歌手们也用他们自己的经验来演绎疯狂的节拍，实验爵士器乐演奏家的独奏。Lambert, Hendricks, Ross陶醉在狂热的合声中，而Betty Carter, Mark Murphy, Abbey Lincoln 则发掘出更激进的即兴演奏方式。尽管70到80年代，人声爵士演奏家日趋减少，还是有很多艺术家坚持不懈，继续这种风格。

Vocal jazz or jazz singing is an instrumental approach to the voice, where the singer can match the instruments in their stylistic approach to the lyrics, improvised or otherwise, or through scat singing; that is, the use of non-morphemic syllables to imitate the sound of instruments.

Probably the easiest genre to define of all as the title says it best. Obviously here is where you will find vocalists who sing in a distictive jazz style, or styles I should say because although there is a similarity of delivery in the jazz nuances of these listed singers, the performing era and genre style of singers you will find here ranges from Billy Holliday to Doris Day and on to Norah Jones.﻿

Most of the 20th century's great vocalists performed in the jazz idiom, though not all rank in the style known as vocal jazz. While singers from Russ Columbo to Doris Day to Johnny Mathis relied on talent and vocal strength alone to carry material, vocal jazz artists instead chose to interpret standards in much the same way as the great jazz instrumentalists, so their readings of the great American songbook required talents related to improvisation, musicianship, harmony, even personalization to bring new meanings to the lyrics. A pair of early giants, Louis Armstrong and Bing Crosby, recorded distinctive readings of standards, relying on a delivery that was casual yet very focused — an almost total break with the professional vocal traditions of the past. From the big-band era came dozens of major jazz vocalists, and in fact, most of the best: Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Tormé, Anita O'Day, Sarah Vaughan, Peggy Lee, Joe Williams; all of them worked long hours touring with swing bands, and most were repaid in kind with major success during the post-war era, when the style really bloomed. Though it wasn't always easy separating jazz vocalists from traditional pop singers, many in the jazz repertoire usually earned the tag by delivering variations of their material in performance or scatting in emulation of a jazz soloist. They also generally refused no-name orchestras and generic pop hits of the day, preferring instead the work of talented arrangers (Nelson Riddle, Billy May) and truly great composers (Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, the Gershwins). Singers of the post-war era began stretching the concepts of not swing but bop, interpreting the frantic tempoes and exploratory solos of jazz instrumentalists with their own vocal experiments. Lambert, Hendricks & Ross indulged in manic harmonies, while a host of singers (including Betty Carter, Mark Murphy, and Abbey Lincoln) explored different charts, radical material, and much improvisation. Even while the ranks of jazz vocalists thinned during the 1970s and '80s, many artists continued in the style.
