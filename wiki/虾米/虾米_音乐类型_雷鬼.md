一种由斯卡（Ska）和洛克斯代迪（Rock Steady）音乐演变而来的牙买加流行音乐。事实上，很难在洛克斯代迪和雷鬼之间划出明确的界限。只是后者较前者更为细腻，更多地使用电声乐器和更加国际化。如果说斯卡音乐还只是在美国流行音乐的影响下产生的一种拉美流行音乐的话 ，那么雷鬼则已发展成为欧美摇滚乐主流中的一种重要体裁了。
雷鬼音乐的起源
　　在1968年左右形成于牙买加(Jamaica)起因是在'60年代，美国音乐工程师兴起和引导的一种音乐表现方式，部分音乐工程师因此出走，寻求灵感。其中有一些来到牙买加。牙买加境内原本就有一些游唱艺人存在，所以一直有股民谣气息在酝酿著；所以这一批美国音乐工程师的到来，对牙买加而言不啻是个提升音乐水准的契 机。加上当地的乐师勇于创新，肯於接受外来事物，于是给予新音乐的创造背景。
源于牙买加
　　雷鬼音乐发源于牙买加，其根源来自New Orleans的R&B。 当时牙买加的乐手根据广播中听到的New Orleans快节奏R&B，发展成属于自己的R&B音乐。 这种称为Ska的音乐型态，在当时60年代相当盛行。然而在一次非常热的夏天， 当地的人无法在高温的户外弹奏如此快节奏的音乐及跳舞。 当地的乐手就将音乐放慢，而形成了 Reggae音乐。 Reggae这个字是源自于「Ragged」，代表牙买加不修边幅的舞蹈形式。
新的音乐形态
　　而在'60年代中期，牙买加已形成一种音乐形态「Ska」，基本上已有雷鬼的影子在，但这种音乐的节奏很快；后来又发展成「Rock Steady」，节奏变得比Ska慢，再经转 变之后，并融入「Soul」(灵魂乐)，於'68年左右，「Reggae」正式成形。
音乐型态

　　雷鬼音乐结合了传统非洲节奏，美国的节奏蓝调及原始牙买加民俗音乐， 这种风格包含了”弱拍中音节省略”，“向上拍击的吉他弹奏”， 以及”人声合唱”。 歌词强调社会、政治及人文的关怀。
雷鬼乐

　　雷鬼乐是早期牙买加的流行音乐之一，它不仅融合了美国节奏蓝调的抒情曲风，同时还加入了拉丁音乐的热情。另外，雷鬼乐十分强调vocal的部份，不论是独唱或合唱，通常它是运用吟唱的方式来表现，并且藉由吉他、打击乐器、电子琴或其他乐器带出主要的旋律和节奏。而在雷鬼乐当中，你还会发现电贝斯占了相当重要的比例！雷鬼乐是属于四四拍的音乐，重音落在第二和第四拍。从音乐中大鼓的部份，我们可以清楚的听出一个明显的节奏和固定的旋律线。拥有自成一派、懒洋洋的独特节奏。

Reggae

　　Reggae的诞生颇为辗转：它演变自Ska，一种急速，结集古巴/非洲爵士乐及美国节奏蓝调的音乐，后来经美国新奥尔良的乐手改良后变成了雷鬼，再传回牙买加。雷鬼与摇滚乐一样，只是一个统称，其支派非常多，有迷幻的Dub、类似R&B的Rocksteady、跳舞节奏的 Ragga，Dancehall Rapping等等，是牙买加最闻名的出产。

Reggae is a music unique to Jamiaca, but it ironically has its roots in New Orleans R&B. Reggae's direct forefather is ska, an uptempo, rhythmic variation based on the New Orleans R&B Jamaican musicians heard broadcast from the US on their transistor radios. Relying on skittering guitar and syncopated rhythms, ska was their interpretation of R&B and it was quite popular in the early '60s. However, during one very hot summer, it was too hot to either play or dance to ska, so the beat was slowed down and reggae was born. Since then, reggae has proven to be as versatile as the blues, as it lends itself to a number of interpretations, from the melodic rock steady of Alton Ellis and the rock and folk-influenced songwriting of Bob Marley to the trippy, near-psychedelic soundscapes of dub artists like Lee "Scratch" Perry. It has crossed into the mainstream through the bright, bouncy "reggae sunsplash" festivals and pop-oriented bands like UB40, but more adventurous reggae artists, such as Marley and Perry, have influenced countless reggae, folk, rock and dance artists. Their contributions resonate throughout popular music.

## Dub 回响

听起来比雷鬼还要沉，并且加入了大量的echo、reverb与delay等效果，让歌曲产生极大的空间感，所以dub基本上就是一种录音的技术，最早出现在1967年，当DJ发现在舞厅中放雷鬼，其实跳舞的群众还蛮爱跟着唱，所以干脆把主唱抽掉，可以让大家合唱，或者是即兴的乱唱，到了1969年，一些人开始创作只有些许主唱的雷鬼歌曲，最早这么作的是U-Roy，他是一个DJ，后来dub大师King Tubby拿U-Roy的歌去重新混音，King Tubby干脆把主唱整个抽掉，并加入了前述的几个效果，马上出现了跟雷鬼感觉不太一样的歌曲，dub也就这样开始了，可是到了1973年开始，才有 dub专辑，当时King Tubby帮几个制作人Bunny Lee与Augustus Pablo等人混音，到了1976年，dub已经变成牙买加很受欢迎的音乐，仅次于最传统的、最草根的雷鬼，也在这个时候传入了英国，这都拜Island 这个英国厂牌所赐，而当初玩雷鬼的一些人，像是Burning Spear与Black Uhuru等也都开始尝试dub，到了80年代，Mad Professor与dub打击乐大师Adrian Sherwood对英国的dub场景贡献卓越，尤其是他所创立的厂牌On-U Sound，90年代，科技日新月异，也让英国出现更多dub乐团，靠着高科技，他们可以更随心所欲的玩dub，也让dub出现了更多种的面貌，像是 ambient dub、experimental dub以及techno-dub等，dub的代表人物与团体有King Tubby、Scientists、Augustus Pablo、The Congos、Keith Hudson、Lee “Scratch” Perry、Prince Jammy以及Sly & Robbie等，较近期的则有Dub Syndicate、知名制作人Bill Laswell等，dub早已成为电子音乐的一个重要元素，知名trip-hop乐团Massive Attack(强烈冲击)就曾经找过Mad Professor料理他们的混音专辑，“嘻哈美国”中也提到，hip hop音乐常用的取样(sampling)概念，其实是来自King Tubby，所以，如果没有dub，就不会有现在这么多面貌的电子音乐。 Dub derives its name from the practice of dubbing instrumental, rhythm-oriented versions of reggae songs onto the B-sides of 45 rpm singles, which evolved into a legitimate and accepted style of its own as those re-recordings became forums for engineers to experiment with the possibilities of their mixing consoles. The practice of re-recording reggae tracks without vocals dated back to 1967, when DJs found that dancehall crowds and partygoers greatly enjoyed being given the opportunity to sing the lyrics themselves. Around 1969, some DJs began talking, or "toasting," over these instrumentals (known as "versions"), frequently reinterpreting the already familiar original lyrics. The most important early DJ was U-Roy, who became renowned for his ability to improvise dialogues with the recorded singers; U-Roy ran the sound system owned by engineer King Tubby, who mixed all of the instrumental tracks over which his DJ toasted. Eventually, Tubby began to experiment with remixing the instrumental tracks, bringing up the level of the rhythm section, dropping out most or all of the vocals, and adding new effects like reverb and echo. The results were seen by many reggae fans as stripping the music down to its purest essence. 45-rpm singles with dub versions on the B-sides became ubiquitous, and King Tubby's credit on the back soon became a drawing card in and of itself. Full-fledged dub albums began to appear in 1973, with many highlights stemming from Tubby's mixes for producers Bunny Lee and Augustus Pablo (the latter of whom also played the haunting melodica, which became one of dub's signature added elements); other key early producers included the minimalistic Keith Hudson and the colorful, elaborate Lee "Scratch" Perry. By 1976, dub's popularity in Jamaica was second only to Rastafarian roots reggae, and the sound had also found acceptance the U.K. (thanks largely to the Island label), where roots reggae artists like Burning Spear and Black Uhuru became just as well-known for their forays into dub. The Mad Professor and the experimental Adrian Sherwood helped Britain's dub scene remain vital in the '80s, but in spite of skilled newcomers like Scientist, Prince Jammy, and Mikey Dread, Jamaican popular taste had by then shifted to DJ toasters and lyrical improvisers, which led to the prominence of dancehall and ragga. The downtempo atmospherics and bass- and rhythm-heavy textures of dub had a lasting influence outside of reggae, beginning with Public Image Ltd.'s 1979 Metal Box/Second Edition album; during the '90s, dub was frequently incorporated into the melting-pot eclecticism of underground avant-garde rock, and Britain's thriving electronica/drum'n'bass scene owed a great deal to dub's mixing and production techniques

## Ska 斯卡

早在50年代的中期，美国的节奏布鲁斯（Rhythm and Blues —也就是我们现在所说的R&B），通过迈阿密、新奥尔良、孟菲斯等地的广播电台传入牙买加后，当地的一些音乐家便将其与牙买加当地的传统民间音乐Mento（门特）相融合，并混杂了美式灵歌的演唱，逐渐形成了Ska（斯卡）音乐。Ska音乐的速度较快，感觉更轻易让人随之舞动蹦跳起来，更加活泼跳跃，节奏强调反拍的重音，乐队中除了采用传统的Mento音乐的乐器（如木吉他、各种拉美打击乐器）外还加入了铜管乐、
　　电吉他、电贝司和键盘等乐器，并突出铜管的华丽色彩。而电吉它的反拍切分演奏技巧也更是体现了Ska音乐的特性，更轻易与其他音乐区别开来。Ska不仅延承了Mento中诙谐的论题和音乐上的特点，其更为欢快的节奏则更能体现出牙买加这个布满阳光和希望的加勒比海岛国的开放与热情。 Ska marked the true beginning of Jamaican popular music, coming to prominence during the early and mid-'60s right around the time the island was granted its independence. Ska ensembles were generally a blend of electric instrumentation and horns most popular in jazz (saxophone, trumpet, trombone).





Although structurally simple, ska has a bevy of influences, synthesizing American R&B, jump blues, Jamaican mento, calypso and other Caribbean styles, big-band swing, Afro-Cuban jazz, pocomania and other local religious folk music, and European ballroom dances. Of those, the first three -- R&B, jump blues, and mento -- were the most important building blocks. Jump blues tunes -- both sax-driven instrumentals and vocal numbers by artists like Wynonie Harris and Louis Jordan -- had become wildly popular at Jamaican dance parties, with sound-system operators making frequent trips to the U.S. searching for the hottest and rarest 45s. As R&B shifted into rock & roll, less crossover-oriented American performers like Little Richard and Fats Domino also became Jamaican favorites. In 1959, when the boogie beat had become less important in rock-oriented R&B, top sound-system owners like Clement "Coxsone" Dodd and Duke Reid (as well as restaurateur-cum-producer Leslie Kong) took matters into their own hands, forming their own labels, acting as producers for local talent, and recording the music their audiences wanted to hear when it was no longer readily available in the U.S. From there, the music took on distinctly Jamaican characteristics, melding influences from all the different styles in which Jamaican instrumentalists had been trained. The most important of these was mento, Jamaica's first indigenous musical form; it was essentially a blend of Caribbean calypso and Jamaican folk music. Mento ensembles used the banjo to play chords on the off-beat, and when this practice was transferred to Jamaican R&B recordings, those off beats were punched up and strongly emphasized because of R&B's emphasis on driving rhythm. This was essentially the birth of ska, and that rhythmic emphasis continued to dominate Jamaican music for decades to come. Important ska vocalists included Derrick Morgan, Laurel Aitken, Prince Buster (himself a sound system owner), Desmond Dekker, Toots & the Maytals, and the very young Bob Marley and the Wailers; the Skatalites, featuring a number of virtuosic soloists and led by the mercurial trombonist Don Drummond, were far and away the top instrumental group, and also served as the house backing band for Coxsone Dodd's prolific Studio One. Ska's popularity declined in 1966, when the slower, cooler rock steady style found favor with younger listeners during the particularly hot summer; moreover, ska lost one of its top performers that year when Don Drummond was arrested for the murder of his girlfriend and committed to an institution (he died there several years later). Ska enjoyed a brief and popular revival in the U.K. during the late '70s and early '80s, thanks to the enthusiasm of many British punk fans for reggae records, and the skipping, infectious ska beat in particular. A more rock-oriented take on ska became popular in the U.S. during the '90s, although it was much farther removed from the music's Jamaican origins than the British version had been.

## Reggae Pop 雷鬼流行

Reggae-Pop has its foundation in reggae, but the music is tempered with strong, melodic hooks, commercial production, and a crossover sensibility. Sometimes, reggae-pop is performed by pop bands seeking to diversify their sounds, but more often it's played by reggae artists with a fondness for pop. During the '70s, such diverse rockers as Eric Clapton and the Clash experimented with reggae, and the entire 2-Tone ska revival movement of the early '80s was closely aligned with reggae. Nevertheless, it wasn't until the '80s -- when artists like UB40, Eddy Grant, and Maxi Priest all established a place for it on the charts -- that reggae-pop became part of the mass consciousness. Reggae-pop first surfaced in the mid-'80s, and flourished toward the end of the decade, as those previously mentioned artists had crossover hits. During the '90s, the style remained strong, even if there weren't as many crossover hits as there were in the late '80s and early '90s.

## Ragga 雷嘎

Ragga与Dancehall密不可分，甚至从音乐形式上来说，Ragga就是Dancehall（Ragga不过是法国人的叫法），其实Ragga就是Raggamuffin的缩写，源自于牙买加首都金斯敦的贫民窟，到了80年代中期，成为牙买加年轻一代相当喜爱的音乐形式，歌词有别于Dancehall的肮脏与暴力，到了90年代，Ragga则对英国的Drum&Bass/Jungle（在英格兰出现的一种音乐类型，转变自Techno音乐，它也是Techno所有子类音乐中一种最具节奏性的混合，音乐中可能什么都没有，但绝对少不了那种速度很快的击鼓声以及很沉的低音）影响深远。 Ragga refers to reggae in which the backing instrumentation (or the vast majority of it) is digital. The style is most commonly associated with dancehall, and while not all dancehall reggae is electronic (and therefore not ragga), there is a great deal of overlap between the two. "Ragga" is short for "raggamuffin," originally a term for a Kingston ghetto youth; the music took on that name as it became the younger generation's style of choice in the mid- to late '80s. Because of the relatively low costs of building synthesized rhythms, ragga became the preferred mode for many Jamaican producers as well, enabling them to turn out thousands of singles per year, and to craft more adventurous new rhythms instead of simply borrowing them from old rock steady records. This also led to the explosion of the "rhythm album," for which different artists would record their own lyrics and melodies over the same pre-existing rhythm track. Although ragga is linked in the minds of many with deejay toasting, straight-ahead singers often address romantic and Rastafarian concerns, and the two vocal styles are frequently mixed as well. The first ragga record was Wayne Smith's 1985 single "Under Me Sleng Teng," which was produced by King Jammy and built around a rhythm that was discovered pre-programmed on a Casio keyboard. Its impact was immediate, spawning a host of imitators and establishing Jammy for a time as Jamaica's most dominant producer. During the '90s, ragga remained firmly entrenched as the most popular sound in Jamaican dancehalls. It began to incorporate hip-hop sampling techniques, and several of its artists scored pop crossover hits in the U.S.; ragga was also an important influence on the U.K.'s thriving jungle/drum'n'bass scene.

## Dancehall 舞厅

Dancehall发展于80年代，最初称作Ragamuffin，音乐的主要结构仍是Reggae，但是速度快了许多，强调大鼓的重拍，有别于Ska/Reggae的慵懒，表演内容通常是DJ在台上以半唱半念饶舌的方式演出，歌词内容却都比较低俗，并经常伴以非常激进的唱腔，称作Dancehall是因为这样的音乐并不适合在电台播放，最合适的地点就是舞池（Dancehall），于是Ragamuffin就有了一个通俗的新名字，Dancehall早期的代表人物有Sizzla、Yellowman、Shabba Ranks等人。到了90年代，Dancehall与美国的Hip-Hop进行了结合，许多帮派饶舌逐渐地加入了Dancehall，使得原本就有肃杀之气的歌曲更加的激进，这股潮流延续了下来，Dancehall也成为Hip-Hop的一个重要元素，同时也创造出像Beenie Man以以及Sean Paul这样的知名巨星。 Dancehall developed in the '80s as "ragamuffin," a hybrid style featuring a DJ or "sing-jay" half-singing, half-rapping with often bawdy ("slack") themes. The musical structure is rooted in reggae though the rhythms, played by drum machines, are considerably faster. By the '90s, dancehall crossover was common, with many gangsta-rappers incorporating dancehall rhythms and its rapid-fire toasting. Major dancehall figures include Yellowman and Shabba Ranks.

## Roots Reggae 根源雷鬼

Roots Reggae美国摇滚和Ska（牙买加流行乐）民族摇滚的杂交，其代表乃强烈的歌唱和虔诚的拉斯特法里主义歌词；这可能是Reggae音乐最容易理解的一 种形式，也是最全球性的一种。Roots reggae浮现于70年代初，并马上发展成为慢拍摇滚的追随者。 A cross between American rock and ska/rock steady, Roots Reggae is typified by strong vocals and devoutly rasta lyrics; it is perhaps the most easily accessible form of reggae, and the most successful globally. Roots reggae emerged during the early 1970s, immediately following the development of rocksteady.

## Contemporary Reggae 当代雷鬼



## Rocksteady 洛克斯代迪

Rocksteady其实代表的正是牙买加音乐的一个高峰，她是ska的其中一个分支。Ska音乐流行于1960至1965年之间，到60年代中期逐渐演变为Rocksteady音乐。Rocksteady与Ska相比，它的速度明显放慢，节奏及旋律更为细腻丰富；其乐队完全采用节奏布鲁斯的组合方式，将吉他作为节奏乐器，用切音技巧演奏松弛而富有韵律的节奏音型；贝司声部的旋律也更具独立性，与华丽的主唱声部构成对位，成为美妙的低音铺垫，相对来说要求有一定的技术性和演奏技巧。60年末，Rocksteady又发展成更具国际性的Reggae（雷鬼）音乐。实际上，很难在Rocksteady和Reggae之间划出明显的界限，只是Reggae比Rocksteady更为细腻，更多地使用电声乐器和更加国际化、商业化而已，没有Rocksteady那么明显的牙买加传统地方特性。不过Rocksteady在Reggae乐的发展中扮演了重要的角色，Rocksteady主要代表艺人有Alton Ellis、Ken Boothe与The Melodians等，他们的歌曲动听，歌词却布满了政治意味，对接踵而至的Reggae做了很好的铺垫，成为Reggae乐的先锋。 Rocksteady was a style of popular music that developed out of ska in the 1960s. In its simplest terms, rocksteady is half-speed ska with the trombone replaced by piano and prominent bass. The lyrics are more socially and politically conscious, and there is a greater focus on harmonies, particularly in trios like the Heptones, Gaylads, Dominoes, Aces, and Wailers. Other major figures include Alton Ellis and Ken Boothe. With its relaxed beat and social-protest lyrics, the music served as a forerunner to reggae.

## Reggaeton 雷吉顿

Reggaeton，也称为reggaetón和reguetón，是一种音乐风格，起源于1990年代末期的波多黎各。它从舞厅发展而来，受到美国嘻哈，拉丁美洲和加勒比音乐的影响。声音包括说唱和唱歌，通常使用西班牙语。
