随着时代的演进，音乐家有了更多制作音乐的方法。所谓电子音乐，就是以电子合成器，音乐软体，电脑等所产生的电子声响来制作音乐。电子音乐范围广泛，生活周遭常常能听到，在电影配乐，广告配乐，甚至某些国语流行歌中都有用到，不过以电子舞曲为最。很多人认为电子乐是一种冷冰冰，没有感情的音乐。其实电子乐也可融入Rock、 Jazz甚至Blues等多种元素而充满情感的。

从广义上来说，电子乐（Electronica）这个词可以指很多的音乐类型，因为电子乐器的使用变的越来越普遍了，而且很多80年代后期的跳舞音乐都是电子的。然而，通常电子乐是指当它刚成形时艺术家们通过电子设备所探索出的各种独一无二的声响，以及后人们所创造出的继承这些先驱们的作品。前卫作曲家们长时间的着迷于利用先进的技术手段，创造那些前所未有的电子声响。法国作曲家Edgard Vare是这个领域的一个先驱，早在上世纪20年代就发明了自己的电子乐设备，50年代一直在实验磁带延时技术。Vare的工作极大的影响了美国前卫艺术家John Cage和德国作曲家Karheinz Stockhausen，后两位极大的扩展了电子乐的曲式结构。然而，直到上世纪70年代，音序器和合成器变得越来越便宜和 简便时，电子乐才真正的进入大众的视野。1968年，Wendy Carlos发行了一张带有迷幻性质的Bach专辑，使用Moog合成器实现了Bach的一些音乐片断。这张专辑在公众中引起了极大的反响，Stockhausen对电子乐器的推广也在德国引起了实验音乐的风潮——Krautrock(德国摇滚)。诸如Can和Neu!等乐队开始将合成器和磁带机的使用带入他们的实验，但是这场风潮中最重要的乐队还是Kraftwerk和Tangerine Dream(橙梦)。
　　Kraftwerk开创了在pop中使用合成器的新观念，他们机器人般的，机械的，催眠性的形式极大的影响了20世纪几乎所有的电子乐。同时，Tangerine Dream受到简约古典作曲技法的启发Kraftwerk乐队，创造了一种称为space的音乐形式，顾名思义，这是一种氛围舒缓的， 曰没惚的音乐。其他重要的艺人还包括Klaus Schulze，他探索了比space还要迷幻的音乐形式；Brain Eno，对于电子元素在pop中的应用有着创造性的发明和实验，可是他最出名还是他的ambient music(氛围音乐)——一种依靠合成器创造出某种环境的音乐类型。
　　 Ambient和space音乐引发了后来的new age(新世纪)，后者强调的是一种安宁的，平和的，深邃的氛围并且旋律及其优美。Progressive electronic(激进电子乐)是new age的一个分支，它表现的是一种更加戏剧化，管弦乐使用更多的形式，从而打破了电子乐根基中的简约风格。此外，诸如synth-pop，techno和 electronica等音乐形式也都在早期的电子乐基础上有了很大的创新。

Reaching back to grab the grooves of '70s disco/funk and the gadgets of electronic composition, Electronica soon became a whole new entity in and of itself, spinning off new sounds and subgenres with no end in sight two decades down the pike. Its beginnings came in the post-disco environment of Chicago/New York and Detroit, the cities who spawned house and techno (respectively) during the 1980s. Later that decade, club-goers in Britain latched onto the fusion of mechanical and sensual, and returned the favor to hungry Americans with new styles like jungle/drum'n'bass and trip-hop. Though most all early electronica was danceable, by the beginning of the '90s, producers were also making music for the headphones and chill-out areas as well, resulting in dozens of stylistic fusions like ambient-house, experimental techno, tech-house, electro-techno, etc. Typical for the many styles gathered under the umbrella was a focus on danceable grooves, very loose song structure (if any), and, in many producers, a relentless desire to find a new sound no matter how tepid the results.

### EDM / Electronic Dance Music 电子舞曲

电子舞曲（Electronic Dance Music）是各种电子音乐的合称，它们的用途往往是在舞厅、派对里用来作跳舞的背景音乐。 电子舞曲流派分为 House、Techno、Trance、Big Beat、Drum `N` Bass、Break Beat和Big Beat、Reggae/Ska、Old school/Miami beat、R`N`B、Tribal、Mambo、Cha Cha、Hip House等等。

Electronic dance music (also known as EDM, dance music,club music, or simply dance) is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. EDM is generally produced for playback by disc jockeys (DJs) who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, by segueing from one recording to another.[4] EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA. In Europe, EDM is more commonly called 'dance music' or simply 'dance'.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the emergence of raving, pirate radio, and an upsurge of interest in club culture, EDM acquired mainstream popularity in Europe. In the United States at that time acceptance of dance culture was not universal, and although both Electro and Chicago house music were hugely influential both in Europe and the USA, mainstream media outlets, and the record industry, remained hostile to EDM. There was also a perceived association between EDM and drug culture which led governments at state and city level to enact laws and policies intended to halt the spread of rave culture.

Subsequently, in the new millennium, the popularity of EDM increased globally, including the United States. By the early 2010s, the term "electronic dance music" and the initialism "EDM" was being pushed by the United States music industry and music press in an effort to rebrand American rave culture. Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the initialism remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including house, techno, trance, drum and bass, dubstep, and their respective subgenres.

### Future Bass 未来贝斯

未来贝斯是在2006年出现的一种新音乐风格，从Trap音乐演变出来，在英国、美国、中国、日本、澳大利亚较为流行。特点是低音（bassline）较重，音色很尖十分跳脱。作为一个相对还在发展的风格，未来贝斯还未定型，同时受到Trap，footwork 和UK garage的影响。


Future bass is a music genre that arose around 2006 in the United Kingdom, United States, China, Japan, and Australia. It is a broad genre of music, offering a wide variety of sounds and rhythms normally produced by a synthesizer on a digital audio workstation.

Future bass is described as having a focus on a hard bassline with detuned synthesizers mostly including sawtooth waves and square waves. The sound waves are often modulated using automation or low-frequency oscillation controlling the cutoff of an audio filter (typically a low pass or high pass filter) making the waveform sound louder or quieter. In addition, it is common to find the utilization of a sort of "twinkly" sounding rise (gradual rise in pitch), including arpeggio chords, and vocoders.
The future bass genre stems from trap, footwork and UK garage. It is related to the post-dubstep movement in the United Kingdom. It is comparable to chiptune and gli

### House 浩室舞曲

HOUSE是於八十年代沿自 DISCO发展出来的跳舞音乐。
为什么会叫"House"呢?就是说只要你有简单的录音设备,在家里都做得出这种音乐~House也是电子乐中 最容易被大家所接受的.
这是芝加哥的DJ玩出的音乐， 他们将德国电子乐团Kraftwerk的一张唱片和电子鼓(Drum Machine)规律的节奏 及黑人蓝调歌声混音在一,House就产生啦,为电子舞曲最基本的型式,4/4拍的节奏, 一拍一个鼓声,配上简单的旋律,常有高亢的女声歌唱. DISCO流行后，一些DJ将它改变，有心将DISCO变得较为不商业化， BASS和鼓变得更深沈， 很多时变成了纯音乐作品，即使有歌唱部分也多数是由跳舞女歌手唱的简短句子，往往没有明确歌词。 渐渐的，有人加入了LATIN(拉丁)、 REGGAE(瑞格源在西印度群岛)、 RAP(说唱)或 JAZZ(爵士)等元素， 至八十年代后期， HOUSE冲出地下范围，成为芝加哥、纽约及伦敦流行榜的宠儿。

Cher唱的Believe 就是个好例子.而M-People可说是House代表团体.House舞曲在1986年开始流行后,可说是取代了Disco音乐.

House可分为：

Acid House 也就是融合了TB-303的Acid声的House乐

Deep House 有着相当浓厚的灵魂唱腔,又叫作Garage,蛮流行化的. 像Real Mecoy, M-People, La Bouche都是Garage团体.

Hard House 简单来说,就是节奏较重,较猛的House.

Progressive House 这类House没啥灵魂唱腔,反而比较注重旋律和乐曲编排.有一 点像"演奏类"的House乐. 像SASH!的专辑It''s My Life便是很好的Progressive House专辑.

Epic House 就是"史诗"House. Epic House有着优美,流畅的旋律和磅礴的气势, 很少会有vocal在里面(几乎是没有!). BT的音乐就是很棒的Epic House,而他也被称作"Epic House天皇". 其实连Rock也有"Epic Rock"

Trible House 想像一下:带有非洲原始风貌或是印地安人的鼓奏的House是啥样? 这就是Trible House~ 这种House除了有一般House稳定的节奏外,在每拍之间,会加入一些带有原始风貌,零碎的鼓点. 蛮有趣的~ 不过,House的范围太广了,大家也不用硬要把一首曲子分类.这些只是告诉大家,House很多种"而已。

到了九十年代， HOUSE已减少了那前卫、潮流色彩，但仍是很受欢迎的音乐。

House music grew out of the post-disco dance club culture of the early '80s. After disco became popular, certain urban DJs -- particularly those in gay communities -- altered the music to make it less pop-oriented. The beat became more mechanical and the bass grooves became deeper, while elements of electronic synth pop, Latin soul, dub reggae, rap, and jazz were grafted over the music's insistent, unvarying four-four beat. Frequently, the music was purely instrumental and when there were vocalists, they were faceless female divas that often sang wordless melodies. By the late '80s, house had broken out of underground clubs in cities like Chicago, New York, and London, and had begun making inroads on the pop charts, particularly in England and Europe but later in America under the guise of artists like C+C Music Factory and Madonna. At the same time, house was breaking into the pop charts; it fragmented into a number of subgenres, including hip-house, ambient house, and most significantly, acid house (a subgenre of house with the instantly recognizable squelch of Roland's TB-303 bass-line generator). During the '90s, house ceased to be cutting-edge music, yet it remained popular in clubs throughout Europe and America. At the end of the decade, a new wave of progressive house artists including Daft Punk, Basement Jaxx, and House of 909 brought the music back to critical quarters with praised full-length works.

### Synthpop 合成器流行

Synth Pop中的 " Synth"，即 Synthesizer(合成器)，顾名思义， Synth Pop就是“由 Sythesizrs炮制出来的流行乐”，当然除 Synthesizers外还会用上其他电子乐器如电脑及鼓机等等。 Synth Pop於八十年代初期开始流行，至八十年代中开始沉寂，当年在香港也曾掀起过一阵热潮。 Synth Pop的特点是科技感强，有时会颇冰冷，歌曲多是“三分钟流行曲” (3-minutes Pop)，很多时 Synth Pop乐手会作入时打扮。
Synthpop (also known as electropop, or technopop) is a genre of popular music that first became prominent in the 1980s, in which the synthesizer is the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic art rock, disco and particularly the "Kraut rock" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the New Wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.Early synthpop pioneers included Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra and British bands Ultravox and the Human League; the latter largely used monophonic synthesizers to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of Tubeway Army and Gary Numan in the British Singles Chart, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including Soft Cell, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Japan and Depeche Mode in the United Kingdom, while in Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synthpop bands such as P-Model, Plastics, and Hikashu. The development of inexpensive polyphonic synthesizers, the definition of MIDI and the use of dance beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synthpop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement, together with the rise of MTV, led to success for large numbers of British synthpop acts, including Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, in the United States.In the late 1980s, duos such as Erasure and Pet Shop Boys adopted a sound that was highly successful on the US dance charts, but by the end of the decade synthpop had largely been abandoned. Interest began to be revived in the indie electronic and electroclash movements in the late 1990s and, in the first decade of the 21st century, it enjoyed a widespread revival with commercial success for acts including La Roux and Owl City.Synthpop received criticism for its limited and artificial sound and for its associations with alternative sexualities. It helped to establish the place of the synthesiser as a major element of pop and rock music, directly influenced subsequent genres including house music and Detroit techno, and has indirectly influenced many other genres and individual recordings.

### Indietronica 独立电子乐

独立电子乐（indietronica 或 indie electronic）是一种综合了独立音乐（英语：indie）、电子乐（英语：electronica）、摇滚（英语：rock）和流行（英语：pop）音乐风格的音乐流派。并伴随着录音/采样技术以及多媒体音乐技术(电脑音乐创作，即Laptop Music)的不断发展而有不同方向上的演绎，电子技术与不同的音乐风格元素相互融合衍生出众多繁杂的电子乐分支，在独立音乐中，独立电子大体上是说那些大量应用采样/拼贴音乐技术，而作品整体上却仍然具有传统的曲式架构(这和很多实验前卫的电子音乐不同)，如娇好的旋律、激赏的节奏等。

特征
独立电子乐中使用的典型乐器是电子琴、合成器、采样器、MIDI控制器和电子鼓等。这类作品在保证不失基本的聆听趣味下，会以各种多彩丰富的电子手法赋予作品独具各色魅力的音乐特色-或飘逸、或空灵、或清凉、或奇幻、或嬗变……从聆听趣味的角度看，独立电子音乐正在为我们拓展出一片极为宽广的聆赏选择空间，这个宽广的真实意义在于小电音乐的创作手法将极大地降低年轻人创作音乐的门槛，很多的独立电子音乐作品创作的物理实体就是一台笔记本电脑，而存于硬盘中的大量音乐素材(有专业的素材库，也可以自己于周遭生活中进行录音)在专业音乐软件的应用中被给予各种变异、剪切以及拼帖等折衷主义色彩的创作手法，这便形成了聆听趣味异彩纷呈的独立电子音乐特色风景。

英文简介
Less a style and more a categorization, Indie Electronic refers to rock-rooted artists who followed early electronic composers (especially the BBC Radiophonic Workshop), Krautrock, synth pop, and dance music by using synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, and computer programs. The initial wave of Indie Electronic artists began in the early '90s, with bands as disparate as Stereolab (who used vintage gear) and Disco Inferno (who pushed sampling technology to the limit). During the early 2000s, the number of indie electronic artists grew exponentially, as home recording and software synthesizers (or softsynths) became common. A few exceptions aside, these artists released their music on independent labels, such as Warp (Broadcast), Morr Music (Lali Puna, Múm), Sub Pop (the Postal Service, Dntel), and Ghostly International ($Skeletons, $School of Seven Bells).(by Allmusic)

### Dubstep 回响贝斯

Dubstep是电子乐的一种，源于伦敦，受新千年早期的英伦车库乐影响，由AMMUNITION PROMOTIONS命名，从音乐理论来说，DUBSTEP以其黑暗色调，稀疏的节奏，和低音上的强调著称，Dubstep一开始只在当地的一些小地方传播，直到后来的2005和06年早期，由于一些网站的传播作用，才使这种类型的音乐得以保留和发展，像DUBSTEPFORUM，下载站点Barefile，还有像GUTTERBREAKZ通过博客来介绍，同时，一些杂志像THE WIRE和网络刊物PITCHFORK MEDIA对其进行了大篇幅报道，在2006年1月期间，BBC电台1的DJ MARY ANNE HOBBS开始用其来做电台秀（命名为DUBSTEP WARZ），之后人们对DUBSTEP越来越感兴趣。


Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London, England. The music website Allmusic has described its overall sound as "tightly coiled productions with overwhelming bass lines and reverberant drum patterns, clipped samples, and occasional vocals".
The earliest dubstep releases date back to 1998 and were darker, more experimental, instrumental dub remixes of 2-step garage tracks attempting to incorporate the funky elements of breakbeat, or the dark elements of drum and bass into 2-step, which featured as B-sides of single releases. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the "Forward" night (sometimes stylized as FWD>>), which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term "dubstep" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and grime.
A very early supporter of the sound was BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who started playing it from 2003 onwards. In 2004, the last year of his show, his listeners voted Distance, Digital Mystikz and Plastician (formerly Plasticman) in their top 50 for the year. Dubstep started to spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006; many websites devoted to the genre appeared on the internet and aided the growth of the scene, such as dubstepforum, the download site Barefiles and blogs such as gutterbreakz. Simultaneously, the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as The Wire and online publications such as Pitchfork Media, with a regular feature entitled The Month In: Grime/Dubstep. Interest in dubstep grew significantly after BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs started championing the genre, beginning with a show devoted to it (entitled "Dubstep Warz") in January 2006.
Towards the end of the decade the genre started to become more commercially successful in the UK, with more singles and remixes entering the music charts. Music journalists and critics also noticed a dubstep influence in several pop artists' work. Around this time, producers also began to fuse elements of the original dubstep sound with other influences, creating fusion genres including the slower and more experimental post-dubstep, and the harsher, electro house and heavy metal influenced brostep, the latter of which greatly contributed to dubstep's rising mainstream popularity in the United States.

### Trap 陷阱舞曲

Trap音乐不断被更多的人所提及，EDM Trap也发展成为新浪潮，在音乐文化愈加发达的中国，Trap也在被人接受，那么追根溯源，Trap音乐是怎么一回事？基于我对Hip-Hop和电子音乐的经验写出一些东西，希望大家能更认真的审视这类音乐一首Harlem Shake让几乎所有人听到了Trap这种音乐，但是Trap音乐究竟是什么？毒品？Purple drank？美女和大麻？如果要让我解释，我的答案是: “Trap是一种极强的snare与浸泡过可待因的传统南部脏Bass自然的结合出的音乐，它将油腻的滴答声甩进了那些沉重的伴奏，人声以及鼓声中，无疑是最淫荡的一种音乐” 如果说我的形容是经过深思熟虑或者略显专业，那Mad Decent的Dirty South Joe给出了最直白的一种答案“Trap音乐是真正的Hip-Hop音乐和跳舞音乐结合而成的一种音乐方式，没人去特意的发明它，只是自然而然的形成了” 那么，Trap是什么意思？ UrbanDic给出了专业的答案 “the act of going to a place in order to make money byselling drugs or other items, most often illegally. common areas are busystreet corners, shopping centers, aparment complexes, and any place of commonlylarge gatherings of people.” 也就是说Trap是指黑人为了生存或更好的生活去贩卖毒品赚钱的行为，也有意指贩毒的地方。所以，Trap出身极其卑微，几乎仅由一部分黑人所喜好和传播，就像DavidDrake说的“Trap在2000年以前根本不是一种音乐风格，它是一个真实的地方” DJ Scream告诉了我们它与音乐的联系，Trap是个开心的地方（因为 ‘The area where drug deals arecarried ou’），所以Trap音乐就是代表一种开心的音乐，当低频响起，所有的一切都是这样一种节奏和氛围。这样的话，也不难理解Trap音乐给人的感觉，因为Trap本身就是一种生活方式，像UGK, Lex Luger, T.I., Rick Ross, Lil Webbie, BunB这样的有关金钱，汽车，美女，舞蹈与奋斗，自然而然充满了油腻，而这些生活方式的存在远比Trap音乐的发展要早很多，如果你知道UGK，你就明白，传统的南部音乐早在80年代就已经形成 如果说真正将Trap音乐推向主流或大众，首先应该感谢的人则是T.I.，很多人知道Trap这个词是从他的第二张专辑”Trap Muzik”开始，而这张专辑的制作人我们看到了现在大名鼎鼎的Diplo，Flosstradamus,Dillon Francis, Flux Pavillion, Rustie, Baauer等等这样的连接着EDM圈子的音乐人和DJ。而之后的Lex Luger则更近了一步，除了为RickRoss制作的B.M.F.还有大名鼎鼎的Kanye West的H.A.M以及Waka Flocka Flame的音乐，而在此时Trap已开始趋向流行化。到了2011年和2012年，除了涌现了808Mafia, Southside, Young Chop这样的Trap音乐以外，更出现了两位牛逼的音乐制作人MikeWiLL Made It和AraabMuzik，他们不仅将Trap推广，更是将R&B与电子音乐和Trap音乐结合，此后更是有了Chief Keef，Future等现在炙手可热的音乐人出现，而同时Trap逐渐登上电子音乐的舞台，被Diplo,Flosstradamus, Baauer这样的音乐人传播，从“Acid Trap”,”Trap-ah-ton”，“TrapStep”这样的叫法到“新Dubstep”直到现在的“EDM Trap”，无疑说明受到更多的青睐。取代了毒品交易和汽车金钱，EDM Trap更接近于club音乐，这样就使得出现了两种争论，归属于EDM还是Hip-Hop。其实未必需要争论，Trap音乐本身就是拥有争议且无法脱离任何一点 (不论EDM或Hip-Hop) 的音乐，就像是Flosstradamus曾经被禁止在Chicago表演，因为他的演出曾出现暴乱，这好像只有摇滚和Hip-Hop现场能看到的景象，这也说明了现代的Trap仍然具有很强的Hip-Hop成分 不管怎么样，Trap音乐是现在炙手可热的音乐风格之一，甚至Diplo已经在BBC上开始了他的固定Trap电台节目，可想而知，Trap的浪潮已经开始。当你听到Miley Cyrus在23中唱 “J’s on my feet”或2Chainz的各种大热单曲甚至M.I.A的音乐时，你可能不会知道，这就是Trap，但是它却无处不在。不论你说它是一种新的音乐，它可能会很快消失，但我相信现在的DJ和音乐人会不断创造改进并找到自己的对于Trap的定位，重新诠释这种音乐，对于电子音乐这个校园来说，毕竟Trap还是个新生。最后，当你听到一首Trap音乐时，别忘了说“Damn Son, Where’dYa Find This!!!” ―—资料来源：Bloodz Boi-怎样定义TRAP MUSIC？(http://www.zhihu.com/question/22157912)

### Trance 出神舞曲

迷幻舞曲,由Techno演变而来,听了会让你有"出神"的感觉,但还是保有舞曲的律动 ,很注重Bass的表现 ,某些听了会有"催眠"的效果.拍子也是以4/4拍为主.
Trance音乐中有很多的电子合成器音色，节奏的变化很少，偶尔的用合成器的来区分节奏的变化。1998年左右，一些全球著名的DJ Paul Oakenfold、Pete Tong、Tong De Vit、Sasha和Judge Jules在英国的很多大型的俱乐部播放trance音乐，最终连美国也开始散布trance音乐，例如Christopher Lawrence。

Breaking out of the German techno and hardcore scene of the early '90s, Trance emphasized brief synthesizer lines repeated endlessly throughout tracks, with only the addition of minimal rhythmic changes and occasional synthesizer atmospherics to distinguish them -- in effect putting listeners into a trance that approached those of religious origin. Despite waning interest in the sound during the mid-'90s, trance made a big comeback later in the decade, even supplanting house as the most popular dance music of choice around the globe.

Inspired by acid house and Detroit techno, trance coalesced with the opening of R&S Records in Ghent, Belgium and Harthouse/Eye Q Records in Frankfurt, Germany. R&S defined the sound early on with singles like "Energy Flash" by Joey Beltram, "The Ravesignal" by CJ Bolland, and others by Robert Leiner, Sun Electric, and Aphex Twin. Harthouse, begun in 1992 by Sven Väth with Heinz Roth &Matthias Hoffman, made the most impact on the sound of trance with Hardfloor's minimal epic "Hardtrance Acperience" and Väth's own "L'Esperanza," plus releases by Arpeggiators, Spicelab, and Barbarella. Artists like Väth, Bolland, Leiner, and many others made the transition to the full-length realm, though without much of an impact on the wider music world.

Despite a long nascent period when it appeared trance had disappeared, replaced by breakbeat dance (trip-hop and jungle), the style's increasing impact on Britain's dance scene finally crested in the late '90s. The classic German sound had changed somewhat though, and the term "progressive" trance gained favor to describe influences from the smoother end of house and Euro dance. By 1998, most of the country's best-known DJs -- Paul Oakenfold, Pete Tong, Tony De Vit, Danny Rampling, Sasha, Judge Jules -- were playing trance in Britain's superclubs. Even America turned on to the sound (eventually), led by its own cast of excellent DJs, including Christopher Lawrence and Kimball Collins.

### Progressive House 前卫浩室

Progressive House前卫浩室，是浩室音乐的一个分支，在4/4拍子的基础上，注重整体的进行和编排，以及整体情绪的推进，优美的旋律也是这个音乐风格重要的一环。Progressive house的根源可以追溯到20世纪90年代初英国，后传播到欧洲，澳大利亚,北美的锐舞和俱乐部现场.在这个时代与US house, UK house, Italian house, German house, and Techno互相影响.在早期Progressive house这个词标签经常与Trance交换使用.在当时锐舞兴旺时期的英国俱乐部Progressive house一词经常作为反锐舞的标签。

Progressive house is a style (subgenre) of house music. The progressive house style emerged in the early 1990s. It initially developed in the United Kingdom as a natural progression of American and European house music of the late 1980s。

Progressive house emerged after the first wave of house music. The roots of progressive house can be traced back to the early 1990s rave and club scenes in the United Kingdom. In 1992, Mixmag described it at the time as a "new breed of hard but tuneful, banging but thoughtful, uplifting and trancey British house." A combination of US house, UK house, Italian house, German house, and techno largely influenced one another during this era. The term was used mainly as a marketing label to differentiate new rave house from traditional American house. Progressive house was a departure from the Chicago acid house sound. The buzz word emerged from the rave scene around 1990 to 1992, describing a new sound of house that broke away from its American roots. Progressive house was viewed by some as anti-rave as its popularity rose in English clubs while breakbeat hardcore flourished at raves.According to DJ Dave Seaman, the sound faced a backlash in the early 1990s because “it had gone the same way as progressive rock before it. Pompous, po-faced and full of its own self importance. But basically was really quite boring."The label progressive house was often used interchangeably with trance in the early years

### Tropical House 热带浩室

Tropical House热带浩室，如字面上理解，是一种充满阳光和度假心情的电子音乐。2013年澳大利亚的制作人Thomas Jack将自己听起来很慵懒的舞曲开玩笑的定义为Tropical House，随后制作人Kygo和Robin Schulz也实验性将这种风格融入到自己的作品中，越来越受欢迎并逐渐在乐坛取得了成功。Tropical house的BPM通常在100-115左右，是Deep House的一个子分支，在House音乐4/4拍的基础上，加入了排笛、马林巴琴、钢鼓、铜管乐器的音色以及人声，给听众营造出一个整体慵懒、欢乐、度假般的休闲氛围。

Tropical house, also known as trop house,[1] is a subgenre of deep house,[2][3] with elements of dancehall and Balearic house.[4] Artists of the genre are often featured at various summer festivals such as Tomorrowland.[5] The genre was popularized by artists including Thomas Jack, Kygo, Matoma, Lost Frequencies, Seeb and Klingande.

The term "Tropical House" began as a joke by Australian producer Thomas Jack, but has since been gaining popularity among listeners.[2] The term "trouse" should not be confused with tropical house, as "trouse" is a genre that instead combines the feeling of trance and the beats of progressive house, using electro synths.[6]

### Future House 未来浩室

未来浩室，是指一种在2010年英国诞生的深度浩室舞曲，这种音乐是在House音乐的基础上，加入了许多新元素。其特点是4/4拍鼓点，每拍一个kick，将Tech house、Electro house用碎拍的手法加以Progressive调和，碎击元素多采用附点，bass音色带有金属感，融合了deep house风格，速度通常在120BPM到128BPM之间。这个风格的代表艺人有Oliver Helden，他的单曲《Gecko》掀起了Future House的热潮，以及Don Diablo，是全球最受喜爱的Future House制作人之一。Future House也被Raver们戏称为敲铁桶，特色的金属音色给予了新的能量，也成为了新一代风靡全球的舞曲风格。

Future house (also known as UK deep house) is an electronic dance music genre that emerged in the 2010s United Kingdom, described as a fusion of deep house, UK garage and other techniques of EDM.

The genre was pioneered by Oliver Heldens, who is credited with popularizing it and Tchami, who coined the term.

Heldens' international chart successes "Gecko (Overdrive)" and "Last All Night (Koala)" brought the genre to wider mainstream recognition in 2014, leading to minor feuds between him and Tchami on social media. Artists such as Don Diablo, Kerri Chandler, Mike Williams, Mesto, Brooks, Curbi and Swanky Tunes have since incorporated the sound into their work, leading some commentators to observe the commercialisation of the style.

### Electro House 电气浩室

顾名思义这类风格是浩室音乐（House music）和电子音乐（Electro）的一个结合，拥有浩室音乐的一个4/4拍的基本特征，但是在音色和段落中糅合了各种不同的合成器元素，因此Electro House可以有许多音乐上的创造性，因此衍生出了许多新的子风格，类似Complextro，Dutch House，Moombahton，Big room等等。

Electro house is a form of house music characterized by a prominent bassline or kick drum and a tempo between 125 and 135 beats per minute. Its origins were influenced by electro,electroclash,electropop,synth-pop,and tech house.The term has been used to describe the music of many DJ Mag Top 100 DJs, including Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Hardwell, Skrillex,and Steve Aoki.

Electro-house is typified by its heavy bass.This is often in the form of buzzing basslines,such as those created with sawtooth waves and distortion.It is also often in the form of large bass drum soundsin a four-on-the-floor pattern.The tempo of electro house is usually around 130 beats per minute.Electro house sometimes resembles tech house,but it can contain melodic elements and electro-influenced samples and synths.

### Moombahton 蒙巴顿舞曲

蒙巴顿舞曲是一种结合了浩室音乐（House）和雷吉顿舞曲（Reggaeton）的新兴舞曲流派，是由美国DJ Dave Nada定义的一种风格，特点是厚实的电气声和慢慢扩散的低音线，；Build up的处理上比较情景化，不像是常规的堆叠式推动情绪，而是放空并切换场景的戏剧式；并且在放慢的Bpm里填充上快而密集的鼓点，并且伴有人声切片样本。Moombahton其实是一种放慢速度的Electro House，并且加入了Reggaeton和Dutch House的元素，有种魔性的节奏律动，充满了拉丁风情。这类风格慢慢受到了各大DJ的青睐，并且随着神曲《Lean On》的出现而火爆全球。

Moombahton is a fusion genre of house music and reggaeton that was created by American DJ and producer Dave Nada (born David Villegas) in Washington, D.C., in 2009. Identifying characteristics of moombahton include a thick and spread-out bass line, dramatic builds; and a two-step pulse, with quick drum fills. Occasionally moombahton includes ravey synthesizers and a cappella rap samples. Nada coined the name as a portmanteau of Moombah (a track by Dutch house DJ Chuckie and producer/DJ Silvio Ecomo), and reggaeton (itself a neologism combining reggae with the Spanish suffix -ton, signifying big).

### Techno 科技舞曲

Techno起源于70年代处（后工业时代），BPM约在130拍以上，中文翻译成“工业舞曲”。House相比Techno要早出现，因为工业时代较电子时代来得早。
Technology， 即表示“高科技舞曲”啦！利用电脑，合成器合成，做出一些特殊音效，这种音乐常常是许多音效组合起来的。 Techno的节拍也是4/4拍，但速度较House快，且听起来具重复性，较强硬，较机械化，所以某些人称Techno为“工业噪音”，但某些还是会注重旋律的。
在典型的Techno舞曲中常要听到工厂中一些重复、机械、固定和单调的音效影子。90年代Techno开始在欧洲逐渐趋于普及，也是我国北方舞厅舞曲的主要组成。Techno较一般舞曲隆重、激烈和嘈杂。
90年代Techno开始在欧洲逐渐趋于普及，也是我国北方舞厅舞曲的主要组成。Techno较一般舞曲隆重、激烈和嘈杂。TECHNO/TECHNO HOUSE来源于80年代中期的底特律和芝加哥，在80年代中晚期还只是地下的非主流音乐，到了89－92年间已成为美国舞潮的主宰者。其特点是：电子合成键盘的强烈电子声、比利时风格的贝斯击乐声、紧凑、狂乱的能量输出及动感，维持在130－150BPM的节奏。NEW BEAT TECHNO舞曲的欧州分支，节奏更重一些。流行于比利时，受到INDUSTRIAL和HI－NRG音乐的影响。
Techno起源于美国底特律，有三名DJ： Derrick May，Kevin Saunderson Juan Atkins尝试将电子乐与黑人音乐结合，而产生了Detroit Techno。 Detroit Techno通常较平缓， 不像一般的Techno那样强劲，可说是现代Techno的起源。

Techno had its roots in the electronic house music made in Detroit in the mid-'80s. Where house still had explicit connection to disco even when it was entirely mechanical, techno was strictly electronic music, designed for a small, specific audience. The first techno producers and DJs -- Kevin Saunderson, Juan Atkins, and Derrick May, among others -- emphasized the electronic, synthesized beats of electro-funk artists like Afrika Bambaataa and synth-rock units like Kraftwerk. In the United States, techno was strictly an underground phenomenon, but in England, it broke into the mainstream in the late '80s. In the early '90s, techno began to fragment into a number of subgenres, including hardcore, ambient, and jungle. In hardcore techno, the beats-per-minute on each record were sped up to ridiculous, undanceable levels -- it was designed to alienate a broad audience. Ambient took the opposite direction, slowing the beats down and relying on watery electronic textures -- it was used as come-down music, when ravers and club-goers needed a break from acid house and hardcore techno. Jungle was nearly as aggressive as hardcore, combining driving techno beats with breakbeats and dancehall reggae -- essentially. All subgenres of techno were initially designed to be played in clubs, where they would be mixed by DJs. Consequently, most of the music was available on 12-inch singles or various-artists compilations, where the songs could run for a long time, providing the DJ with a lot of material to mix into his set. In the mid-'90s, a new breed of techno artists -- most notably ambient acts like the Orb and Aphex Twin, but also harder-edged artists like the Prodigy and Goldie -- began constructing albums that didn't consist of raw beats intended for mixing. Not surprisingly, these artists -- particularly the Prodigy -- became the first recognizable stars in techno.

### Ambient 氛围音乐

Ambient（氛围音乐）源于70年代艺术家们的一种实验性的电子合成音乐，代表人物如Brian Eno、Kraftwerk以及Harold Budd，同时也具有80年代trance风格的数码舞蹈乐曲。氛围音乐是一种有足够空间让人发挥的有着声波结构的电子音乐。它没有作词或作曲的束缚。尽管艺术家在创作之间有暗示性的差异，但对于偶然一次的听众来说，它只是不断地在重复和没有变化的声音。

Ambient music evolved from the experimental electronic music of '70s synth-based artists like Brian Eno and Kraftwerk, and the trance-like techno dance music of the '80s. Ambient is a spacious, electronic music that is concerned with sonic texture, not songwriting or composing. It's frequently repetitive and it all sounds the same to the casual listener, even though there are quite significant differences between the artists. Ambient became a popular cult music in the early '90s, thanks to ambient-techno artists like the Orb and Aphex Twin.

### Chillout 弛放

Chillout（弛放）音乐是一个统称词汇，不是一个单独的流派，从流派的角度说它包括了电子音乐、爵士乐、Smooth Jazz、Cabaret、流行钢琴曲、Post-rock、新世纪音乐等，但并不是所有这些流派的音乐都属于Chillout。Chillout音乐需要符合以下特征：具有让人放松、休息、舒缓情绪的功能，具有慵懒闲适的气氛，常有现代大都市的感觉（也有的描绘自然风景），适合伴随听者进入梦乡。

### Complextro 复合电气

Complextro（复合电气），如同字面上理解，是一种比较「复杂」的电子音乐，是由Electro House（电气浩室）衍生的一种新的浩室舞曲风格，Complextro融合的风格比较多，它是以House的鼓点为基础，通常会融合dubstep惯用的wobble音色，速度通常为100，也有128的，brostep（post dubstep）音色表现较多，节奏方面是四拍house鼓点，有些complextro作品会在第二拍和第四拍叠加snare或clap声音，再加上一些混乱的切片而形成的一种风格，skrillex的rock n roll就是一首典型的complextro风格作品。

Complextro is typified by glitchy, intricate basslines and textures created by sharply cutting between instruments in quick succession.[20][21] The term, a portmanteau of the words "complex" and "electro",[20][21][22] was coined by Porter Robinson to describe the sound of the music he was making in 2010.[22][23] He has cited video game sounds, or chiptunes, as an influence on his style of music along with 1980s analog synth music.[24] Other producers of the genre include Adventure Club, Kill The Noise, Knife Party, Lazy Rich,[25] The M Machine, Madeon,[20] Virtual Riot, and Wolfgang Gartner.

### Drum & Bass 鼓打贝斯

Jungle承袭了Hardcore的精神，听起来很〝硬〞，其碎拍更是迷人，也常出现一些Rap，使Jungle有很重的黑人味（其实早期许多Jungle乐手都是黑人）。基本上，要做出又快又复杂的节拍任何人都会，但如何在复杂且快速的节奏中，让听众了解〝你到底在做什么〞，就不是件容易事了。 一些Jungle先锋如Goldie等人，其对于节拍建构的功力真是一等一。
　　
　　相较于Jungle，约95年左右出现的Drum''n''Bass，则结合了Jazz乐风，柔和了许多。顾名思义，Drum''n''Bass就是著重于鼓声和低音的表现。鼓声可能全部采用电子合成，也可能取样自真实鼓声。而它的Bass声则是显得格外巨大，有时声音还会扩散开来。但Drum''n''Bass音乐也可能清一色使用鼓声，然后将大鼓的声音用效果器〝压扁〞成Bass声。这类低音相当有压迫感，有点撞击的感觉，耳朵很容易听出来。但也有乐团有时使用真实的低音大提琴负责低音部份，如英国的4 Hero乐团。

　　虽说Drum''n''Bass有如Jungle的改良，但它俩其实界线不是非常明确。若是你听到曲子的节拍又快又复杂，或是很难抓它的节奏感，那可能就是Jungle/Drum''n''Bass了。

Based almost entirely in England, Jungle (also known as drum'n'bass) is a permutation of hardcore techno that emerged in the early '90s. Jungle is the most rhythmically complex of all forms of techno, relying on extremely fast polyrhythms and breakbeats. Usually, it's entirely instrumental -- it is among the hardest of all hardcore techno, often consisting of nothing but fast drum machines and deep bass. As its name implies, jungle does have more overt reggae, dub, and R&B influences than most hardcore -- and that is why some critics claimed that the music was the sound of black techno musicians and DJs reclaiming it from the white musicians and DJs who dominated the hardcore scene. Like most techno genres, jungle is primarily a singles genre designed for a small, dedicated audience, although the crossover successes of Goldie (with his 1995 debut Timeless) and Roni Size (with the Mercury Award-winning New Forms) suggested a broader appeal and more musical possibilities than other forms of techno. Dozens of respected artists followed in their wake, fusing breakbeat with influences lifted from jazz, film music, ambient, and trip-hop.

### UK Garage 英国车库舞曲

英国车库舞曲（UK Garage）是浩室舞曲（House）的后来产物。最初的浩室舞曲是产生于美国的芝加哥、纽约等地。1990年代中期，当它来到英国的俱乐部，Todd Edwards等DJ在传统的浩室舞曲加入了一些雷鬼乐元素、变调的女声采样、倒带及搓碟声效，搭配扭曲的鼓打贝斯（Drum'n'Bass）节奏。英国车库舞曲的早期被称为速度车库舞曲（Speed Garage），不久以后，节奏布鲁斯（R&B）、嘻哈（Hip Hop）等都市元素逐渐融入其中，演化成二步舞曲（2-Step）、
回响重拍 （Dubstep）等多种更流行的子风格。

特征
英国车库舞曲在很多乐迷眼里是一种非常含糊的风格，因为它的包容性。由于英国文化的多元性，DJ们在传统的浩室舞曲加入了很多流行元素，并将不同类型的采样及变化的节奏运用其中，所以不同的UK Garage作品也是有鲜明的差异的。

流行时段
1990年代中期至今

英文简介
UK garage (also known as UKG) is a genre of electronic music originating from England in the early 1990s. UK garage is a descendant of house music which originated in Chicago, Detroit, New Jersey and New York. The genre usually features a distinctive syncopated 4/4 percussive rhythm with 'shuffling' hi-hats and beat-skipping kick drums. Garage tracks also commonly feature 'chopped up' and time-shifted or pitch-shifted vocal samples complementing the underlying rhythmic structure. UK garage was largely subsumed into other styles of music and production in the mid-2000s, including dubstep, bassline and grime. The decline of UK garage during the mid-2000s saw the birth of UK funky, which is closely related.(by Wikipedia)

### Bubblegum Bass 泡泡糖贝斯

Bubblegum Bass（有时被称为PC music、bubblebass、post-ringtone、hyper pop 或 bubblegum badass）是起源于20世纪20年代早期的一种电子舞曲。它将流行音乐中的可爱和女性化特征放大到极致。常见的表现形式为可爱有趣的流行音乐与UK Bass、Wonky音乐的融合。
SOPHIE和A.G.Cook是这个类型中最著名的两个制作人，后者创建的PC Music也成为了Bubblegum Bass最具代表性的音乐厂牌。

Bubblegum Bass (sometimes called PC music, bubblebass, post-ringtone, hyper pop or bubblegum badass) is a style of Electronic Dance Music that originated in the early 2010s. It takes Pop music and amplifies its cuteness and femininity to extreme levels, often pitching the vocals upward and warping the rhythm through a frenzied UK Bass and Wonky filter. The production uses bouncy, plastic-sounding synths and further draws from a variety of club sounds, including Electro House, Balearic Beat, Trance, Footwork, and Bubblegum Dance.

SOPHIE and A. G. Cook are the two best known producers in this genre; the latter producer's label PC Music is the label most associated with the genre. A disorienting post-internet aesthetic exemplified by DIS Magazine also shapes the style of Bubblegum Bass both sonically and visually, though DIS's output is not exclusively centered on Bubblegum Bass.

### Downtempo 缓拍

喜欢沙发音乐的人一定永远也听不厌downtempo，这个音乐和chill-out也有点像，从名字上就可以知道，音乐节拍慢慢的，是一种可以坐在家里休息时收听的音乐，这种音乐比chill-out和ambient音乐多了点拍子，更有种节奏感，但是相对trip-hop来又简单朴素了很多。音乐听上去的感觉柔柔的但很有弹性，有种抚慰人心的感觉。

Downtempo artists tend to be more beat-oriented than ambience, but are not quite as earthy as trip-hop.

### Breakbeat 碎拍

Breakbeat（也称Broken Beats）是对80年代后期的House（库房）加以采样和编排，将原先House的那种有规则的“咚咚咚”的鼓点声加以破碎化手法表现出来，并加以Sampling（采样）、Breaks（暂停）、Cuts（间断）等手法修饰。而Break Beat则是此类的一个总称，之下以特征更分Big Beat，Nu Breaks，Drum’n’Bass，Brit Hop等等，在此介绍Breaks的范畴，也就是以Nu Breaks/Big Beat为主，BPM略低的一类，而Drum’n’Bass因形成一定气候，几乎脱离Broken Beat的范畴，成为一种新的单独类型

More a scene centered in West London than an easily fenced-in sound, broken beat looks as far back to '70s Jazz-Funk and Dub Reggae while also containing germs from '80s and '90s movements like house, techno, drum'n'bass, and contemporary R&B. Unlike the polite tendencies of acid jazz -- a movement of the '80s and '90s that also blended several styles -- broken beat takes its inspirations as mere launching points and often utilizes frenetic, syncopated beat structures that sound sputtery and stuttered more often than they sound straightforward. Vocalists, predominantly female, feature in many of the tracks, all of which are bold, bright, and -- for the most part -- full of rhythmic tension. Keyboards are another major factor, often taking cues from the likes of George Duke andHerbie Hancock. Immediately after its late-'90s germination, broken beat underwent a fast growth throughout West London. Several labels (2000 Black, Bitasweet, People, Co-Op, Laws of Motion, Main Squeeze) were started by producers -- producers who often worked under several aliases. The fact that the scene was heavily reliant upon collaborations made the style's family tree all the more difficult to diagram. Outposts have since developed in several other countries, including Canada, Japan, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy.

### Vaporwave 蒸汽波

蒸汽波（Vaporwave）是一种音乐流派和艺术运动。
在2010年代初期出现了一些Indie Dance，如seapunk，bounce house, 或 chillwave，以及更广泛地说，电子舞曲。这为Vaporwave找到了一个巢穴。Vaporwave兴起于2010年初期，2014~2015年几乎达到全盛时期，关于vaporwave的音乐创制和艺术作品开始崭露头角，到现在已经衍生出一系列的子文化和周边产品。虽然有很多的多样性和模糊性的亚风格类别和信息传达，vaporwave有时既是批评和讽刺后工业时代的消费主义社会，80年代的雅皮士文化，和新世纪音乐，但同时那种低保真音质和Album Art展示了好奇与迷恋的怀旧文物。
Vaporwave是一种音乐流派和艺术运动，在2010年代初期出现了从一些Indie Dance，如seapunk，bounce house, 或 chillwave，以及更广泛地说，电子舞曲。
虽然有很多的多样性和模糊性的亚风格类别和信息传达，vaporwave有时既是批评和讽刺后工业时代的消费主义社会，80年代的雅皮文化，和新世纪音乐，但同时那种低保真（LO-FI）音质和Album Art展示了好奇与迷恋的怀旧文物。
和vaporwave前几年较为流行的一些类似风格相比，比如hypnagogic pop，hypnagogic pop是一种“让我乘着时光机回到了童年，看着美国卡通片，手里拿着玩具和虾条儿，一种昏昏欲睡的半梦半醒的状态”“把声音搞的恍惚遥远，这是来源于80后小时候的一种对于房间外面依稀传来的disco、电影等声音的回忆，一种年轻的创作者身上的无尽孩提回忆。”如果说hypnagogic pop建立一种乌托邦式气场，技术上用噪音，用disco采样，声音混杂\怀旧\加上来自于洛杉矶身上的嬉皮气质。
那么Vaporwave就是纯粹的那种1995年日式赛博朋克式的反乌托邦式一种完全架空的的，像是另一个平行世界的流行音乐。

### Disco 迪斯科

迪斯科（英文：Disco)，来自法语的discothèque，意指那些播放录制好的跳舞音乐的舞厅。舞蹈是来源于美国黑人民间舞蹈和爵士舞。近几年在世界，特别是欧洲风靡一时的伴舞音乐，节奏是混合了爵士乐、摇滚乐以及拉丁美洲音乐的某些节奏特点。

与摇滚相比，它的特点是强劲的、不分轻重的、像节拍器一样作响的4/4拍子，歌词和曲调简单。

1977年，因澳大利亚流行音乐小组“比吉斯”（Bee Gees）的电影录音《周末狂热》在美国掀起迪斯科热。迪斯科经常在录音室进行音响合成，制成唱片，但终因节奏单调、风格雷同，于80年代初逐渐被其他节奏不那么显著、速度稍慢的流行舞曲所代替。

Disco marked the dawn of the modern era of dance-based popular music. Growing out of the increasingly groove-oriented sound of early '70s and funk, disco emphasized the beat above anything else, even the singer and the song. Disco was named after discotheques, clubs that played nothing but music for dancing. Most of the discotheques were gay clubs in New York, and the DJs in these clubs specifically picked soul and funk records that had a strong, heavy groove. After being played in the disco, the records began receiving radio play and respectable sales. Soon, record companies and producers were cutting records created specifically for discos. Naturally, these records also had strong pop hooks, so they could have crossover success. Disco albums frequently didn't have many tracks — they had a handful of long songs that kept the beat going. Similarly, the singles were issued on 12-inch records, which allowed for extended remixes. DJs could mix these tracks together, matching the beats on each song since they were marked with how fast they were in terms of beats per minute. In no time, the insistent, pounding disco beat dominated the pop chart, and everyone cut a disco record, from rockers like the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart to pop acts like the Bee Geesand new wave artists like Blondie. There were disco artists that became stars — Donna Summer, Chic, the Village People, and KC & the Sunshine Band were brand names — but the music was primarily a producer's medium, since they created the tracks and wrote the songs. Disco lost momentum as the '70s became the '80s, but it didn't die — it mutated into a variety of different dance-based genres, ranging from dance-pop and hip-hop to house and techno.

### Folktronica 电子民谣

电子民谣（Folktronica）是将民谣（Folk）和电子乐（Electronica）的结合。通常是将原声乐器，特别是弦乐，通过电子设备进行采样，辅助搭配一些电子乐中的常用节奏（比如嘻哈节奏或者舞曲节奏）模式生成的作品。最先使用这个词的是BurnitBlue.com网站的Jim Byers，用来描述Badly Drawn Boy在作品中的创新，后来Four Tet等音乐人让此风格走向成熟。

 特征
 和传统民谣相比，电子民谣的制作过程中会有电脑等数字设备的参与。它是一种折衷的做法，将民谣中的人情味与电子中的科技味进行融合，将两者热和冷的优点互补。

 流行时段
 2000年后至今

 英文简介 
 or electrofolk is a genre of music comprising various elements of folk  music and electronica, often featuring samplings of acoustic  instruments—especially stringed instruments—and incorporating hip hop or dance rhythms.Typically, computers are used during the recording  process.					

### Brostep 后回响重拍

后回响重拍（Brostep）是由Dubstep分裂出来的一个音乐类型。
 Dubstep起源于英国，而Brostep起源于美国，Bostep是受了英国的Dubstep演变过来的。

 Brostep相对于Dubstep来说，情绪上更加活跃一些，音色也更加张扬，而Dubstep则偏向于阴暗，有种昏昏沉沉的感觉。
 Brostep的跳跃性比Dubstep强，节奏比较紧凑，而Dubstep的节奏比较稀疏。					

### Deep House 深浩室舞曲

深浩室舞曲（Deep  House）是浩室舞曲（House）下的一个子风格，在1980年代末开始发展。它尝试将灵魂乐（Soul）、爵士乐（Jazz）等元素融入其中。在芝加哥浩室舞曲（Chicago House）的浓郁的科技味道之上加入了更多人情味，它也算是向已经退潮的迪斯科（Disco）的一次回溯。

 特征
 Deep House有着相当浓厚的灵魂唱腔,之所以称为Deep House就是因为有深邃的感觉，Deep  House风格介于Garage和House之间，它同样源于Chicago，也许是这个老工业城市沉重阴郁的现实色调赋予了Deep  House同样的气质，使得这种音乐更适合聆听而不是酣畅起舞。滚滚而来的Bassline，一反常态的人声代替采样，间或闪烁其间的Jazz  Chord，有时Deep House听上去就像郁闷版的Garage。Deep House崇尚的是深度,精神至上,更偏重Jazz和Soul的感觉. 

 流行时段
 1980年代中末期至今

 英文简介
 Deep house is a subgenre of house music that originated in the 1980s,  initially fusing elements of Chicago house with 1980s jazz-funk and  touches of soul music. (by Wiki)					

### IDM 智能舞曲

IDM全称是Intelligent Dance  Music，这种音乐既适合派队和跳舞，也适合躺在家里的沙发欣赏，产生于80年代末期的IDM音乐，在舞曲音乐的基础上更趋向于downtempo（电音类型之一），Warp Records是著名的发行过很多IDM专辑的厂牌，还有一些其他一些发行过高质量IDM音乐的厂牌：Rising High，Rephlex，Fat Cat，Astralwerks，M-Tronic Records。到90年代末，产生了很多固定的厂牌，包括Drop  Beat，Isophlux，Suction，Schematic，Cytrax。

 A loaded term meant to distinguish electronic music of the '90s and  later that's equally comfortable on the dancefloor as in the living  room, IDM (Intelligent Dance Music) eventually acquired a good deal of  negative publicity, not least among the legion of dance producers and  fans whose exclusion from the community prompted the question of whether they produced stupid dance music. Born in the late '80s, the sound grew out of a fusion between the hard-edged dance music heard on the main  floor at raves and larger club events, and the more downtempo music of  the nearby chill-out rooms. DJs like Mixmaster Morris and Dr. Alex  Patersonblended Chicago house, softer synth-pop/new wave, and  ambient/environmental music, prompting a wave of producers inspired by a variety of sources. (Many DJs and producers were also reacting against  the increasingly chart-leaning slant of British dance music during those years, exemplified by novelty hits like "Pump Up the Jam" by  Technotronic and "Sesame's Treat" by Smart E's.) Sheffield'sWarp Records proved home to the best in the sound -- in fact, the seminal Warp  compilation Artificial Intelligence alone introduced listeners worldwide to a half-dozen of the style's most crucial artists: Aphex Twin, the  Orb, Plastikman, Autechre, Black Dog Productions, and B12. Other labels  -- Rising High, GPR, R&S, Rephlex, Fat Cat, Astralwerks -- released  quality IDM as well, though by the mid-'90s much of the electronica  produced for headphone consumption had diverged either toward the path  of more experimentation or more beat orientation. With no centered,  commercial scene to speak of, North America became a far more hospitable clime to IDM, and by the end of the '90s, dozens of solid labels had  opened for business, including Drop Beat, Isophlux,Suction, Schematic,  and Cytrax. Despite frequent attempts to rename the style (Warp's  "electronic listening music" and Aphex Twin's "braindance" were two  choices), IDM continued to be the de facto way for fans to describe  their occasionally undescribable favorites.					

### Ambient Techno 氛围科技舞曲

氛围科技舞曲（Ambient  Techno）是科技舞曲（Techno）下的一个子风格。是科技舞曲（Techno）和氛围音乐（Ambient）的结合。氛围科技舞曲是氛围浩室舞曲（Ambient House）的承接。相对于之前的底特律科技舞曲（Detroit  techno）更适于集体跳舞的特征，氛围科技舞曲更倾向于个人主义的实验。主要实践厂牌有Apollo、GPR, Warp和 Beyond。

 特征
 氛围科技舞曲具有传统科技舞曲的一般特点：808和909型鼓机带来的特定节奏；良好的制作手法、稀疏的电子音效；小调（Minor  Key）的旋律；富有外太空科技感的声音采样。由于引入了氛围音乐的实验性特征，在保留了传统的疏离科技感外，它能让听众更松弛舒缓，也同时带来更多的想象空间。

 流行时段
 1990年代初至今

 英文简介
 A rarefied, more specific reorientation of ambient house, Ambient Techno is usually applied to artists such as B12, early Aphex Twin, the Black  Dog, Higher Intelligence Agency, and Biosphere. It distinguished artists who combined the melodic and rhythmic approaches of techno and electro  -- use of 808 and 909 drum machines; well-produced, thin-sounding  electronics; minor-key melodies and alien-sounding samples and sounds -- with the soaring, layered, aquatic atmospheres of beatless and  experimental ambient. Most often associated with labels such as Apollo,  GPR, Warp, and Beyond, the terminology morphed into "intelligent techno" after Warp released its Artificial Intelligence series (although the  music's stylistic references remained largely unchanged).(by Allmusic)		 		

### Trip Hop 神游舞曲

Trip-Hop是英伦／欧洲跳舞音乐的一种，它的名字来源是“ Trip＋ Hip Hop"＝ Trip-Hop"，因为它发源自英国的Bristol，因此最早时称作"Bristol Hip-Hop".。

　　由于是把Hip-Hop（其实很多音乐都是架构在Hip-Hop上的...不知啥是Hip-Hop的去看看跳街舞的人, 他们多半是用Hip-Hop音乐来跳的.）节奏变慢(有时很慢很慢),加入一些迷幻的味道,如很阴沉,肥厚的Bass,轻微但迷幻的 合成音效,或是些唱片的取样,有时可能连唱片的杂音都会被"故意"取样进去.所谓“ Trip"，指迷幻，氤氲的药物「旅程」，所以， Trip-Hop是种慢板的迷幻的、有 Jazz感觉的、迷糊的、带点 Hip Hop节奏的 Break beat音乐。它虽然隶属跳舞音乐类，但其迷幻迷糊特色已令它跳一般跳舞音乐所有的明确节拍特色相去很远。
　　（神游舞曲）trip hop 是最新形成的伦敦街头舞曲，它大量使用小调合弦，而且加入从恐怖片和科幻片中取来的电影配乐。字面上"trip"的解释是「旅行」、「吸食毒品后的幻觉状态」，很明显地显示出了
　　trip-hop 的感官世界而"hop"一字则代表着其源自于hip-hop的过程。因此"trip-hop"我称它为神游，在trip-hop 的世界里，你可以是神游于黑暗的地狱（terrific type of trip-hop），你可以是神游于光明的天堂（non-terrific type of trip-hop），你会发现自己总彷佛陷入在迷失与希望的犹疑陷阱之中。

起源及形成

　　trip-hop 起源于９０年代英国bristol 一地，在欧洲不断面临美国hip-hop 侵入的冲击之时，英国的dj 们即开始将hip-hop 发展成自己的风格，他们将hip-hop的速度降慢（较为downtempo），强调沉重缓慢的鼓声及bass，抽掉hip-hop中的rap，于是形成了所谓的bristol hip-hop（trip-hop 之前身，当时尚未有trip-hop 这个名词）。至于真正trip-hop兴盛的关键时期则是在９４、９５年massive attack 推出第二张唱片「protection」，以及portishead 和tricky 的崛起。从portishead 女主唱beith gibbson 颓废、慵懒的唱腔加上６０、７０年代老旧唱片的sample（甚至唱片的杂音），到tricky 喃喃自语般愤世嫉俗的低沉声音，将bristol sound 营造出了一种迷幻抽象、黑暗诡谲的新环境。于是便有杂志将他们这种音乐型态称之为"trip-hop"

特点

　　（神游舞曲）是英国评论界创造出来的一个新名词，他们想要用这个词来描述一种兼有落魄、爵士、疯克、和受灵魂乐影响的实验性破拍舞曲的特色的新型音乐风格。神游舞曲与迅速转化成为实验性地下音乐的英国后酸性浩室舞曲（post-acid house dance）一脉相承，但它最早出现是在1993年，同时出现的还有一些厂牌，如 MoWax, Ninja Tune, Cup of Tea, 和 Wall of Sound. 它有很多地方与美国的hip-hop很相似（虽然大部分时候剔除了人声），它同样喜欢使用取样性的鼓点突变、同样具有典型的实验性、并喜欢把对氛围音乐的高度倾向性和明显的精神迷幻气氛（所以才会“神游”）结合在一起，于是这个词很快被用来形容所有来源于 Portishead and Tricky, DJ Shadow and U.N.K.L.E., Coldcut, Wagon Christ, 和 Depth Charge 的音乐 --- 而这让这些音乐人非常的气恼，因为他们发现人们只是把他们的音乐看作是固有的hip-hop的一种延续，而不是一个巧妙的创造性的分支。作为商业上重要的混合产物之一 --- 它成功地将跳舞时听的音乐与更加主流的听众交织在了一起 --- 神游舞曲的一系列唱片理所当然的占据了英国独立排行榜的榜首；而像 Shadow, Tricky, Morcheeba, the Sneaker Pimps, 和 Massive Attack这样的艺人，则在为了获取美国本土听众而发起的电子运动（"electronica"）第一次浪潮中成为了中坚力量

Yet another in a long line of plastic placeholders to attach itself to one arm or another of the U.K. post-acid house dance scene's rapidly mutating experimental underground, Trip-Hop was coined by the English music press in an attempt to characterize a new style of downtempo, jazz-, funk-, and soul-inflected experimental breakbeat music which began to emerge around in 1993 in association with labels such as Mo'Wax, Ninja Tune, Cup of Tea, and Wall of Sound. Similar to (though largely vocal-less) American hip-hop in its use of sampled drum breaks, typically more experimental, and infused with a high index of ambient-leaning and apparently psychotropic atmospherics (hence "trip"), the term quickly caught on to describe everything from Portishead and Tricky, to DJ Shadow and U.N.K.L.E., to Coldcut, Wagon Christ, and Depth Charge -- much to the chagrin of many of these musicians, who saw their music largely as an extension of hip-hop proper, not a gimmicky offshoot. One of the first commercially significant hybrids of dance-based listening music to crossover to a more mainstream audience, trip-hop full-length releases routinely topped indie charts in the U.K. and, in artists such as Shadow, Tricky, Morcheeba, the Sneaker Pimps, and Massive Attack, account for a substantial portion of the first wave of "electronica" acts to reach Stateside audiences.

### Glitch Hop 脉冲流行

脉冲流行（Glitch Hop）顾名思义，是将脉冲（Glitch）技术用在流行乐结构中的一种手法。Glitch技术在90年代初成熟并发展，Junior Boys、Bjork、Mice Parade、Ellen Allien等流行音乐人都尝试在自己的作品中加入Glitch元素进行点缀。

特征
传统的Glitch作品重点强调Glitch所拼贴出的氛围色彩，而对于流行音乐人，Glitch元素则是他们的一项辅助法宝，不同的配置手法都可以产生独特的效果，比如烘托氛围感、增强想象力，节奏之间的巧妙交融、制造迷幻效果、增加趣味性等等。

### Future Garage 未来车库舞曲

未来车库舞曲（Future Garage）是英国车库舞曲（UK Garage）的一个子风格，在2000年代中后期发展迅速。顾名思义，它是将旧的车库舞曲（Gagare）翻新成具有未来感（Future）的呈现理念。在这之前，回响重拍（Dubstep）是UK Garage发展很热门的一个趋势，但是也有一些Dubstep音乐人开始摒弃Dubstep的一些特征，转而回到UK Garage / 2-step最开始的清淡，但是仍借鉴了很多2000以后才出现的新的制作手法。算是新与旧的结合。

特征
Future Garage没有Dubstep那样过度浑厚摇晃的贝斯。它虽然回到UK Garage的清淡，但是相比UK Garage更适合俱乐部跳舞的特点，Future Garage更适合室内聆听，它借鉴了一些智能舞曲（IDM）的制作手法，通常有着极简主义的思路，制作更光洁，旋律更悦耳。


流行时段
2000年代中期至今

英文简介
Future Garage is a newer style of UK Garage which originally developed as a result of some Dubstep producers reacting against the prevalent trends in that genre. These producers made music which was far closer to the 2-Step and UK Garage of the late 90s and early 00s than that of their contemporaries, deliberately eschewing the heavy wobble bass commonplace in dubstep. The other distinguishing feature of Future Garage is that it is much more accessible for "home listening" than UK Garage was - IDM is often a clear influence. The resulting sound is often quite minimalistic, with skittery, broken rhythms and bright, clean melodies. (by Rateyourmusic)

Of the dubstep producers who pioneered this strand of UK garage, the best known is Burial, along with many others on Hyperdub. Futher back in time, there are also clear similarities with the music of MJ Cole and the Broken Beat movement of the early 00s. The term Future Garage was originally coined by Sub.fm's Whistla, who also set up L2S Recordings, the genre's first dedicated label. Other notable artists include FaltyDL, Brackles, Shortstuff, and Joy Orbison.

### Wonky 恍惚嘻哈舞曲

恍惚嘻哈舞曲（Wonky）是回响重拍（Dubstep）和嘻哈（Hip Hop）（特别是Glitch Hop）的结合，它出现于2000年代中后期。除了这两种元素外，它也受到诸如智能舞曲（IDM）和摇晃科技舞曲（Wonky Techno）的影响。当时一些Hip Hop艺人如J Dilla 和Madlib想尝试一些Dubstep和IDM的元素，而同时一些Dubstep制作人也开始将Hip Hop的节拍融入到自己的作品中，双方契合的想法也让这种风格在2009年开始成熟。

基本特征
不规则的Hip Hop节奏在Dubstep的速率中行进，有一种恍惚的、不稳定的听感。它也和克他命等药物相关，营造出在迷幻中跳舞的氛围。

英文简介
Wonky is the name given to a fusion of Dubstep and Hip Hop (particularly Glitch Hop) which first developed in the mid-to-late 2000s. Along with those main elements it also has secondary influences such as IDM and its namesake, Wonky Techno. It is defined by its off-kilter and unstable, wonky (hence the name) mid-range, with unquantised and offbeat hip-hop rhythms at dubstep tempos; this sound was at least partially influenced by and is often linked to ketamine use, as it reflects how the drug affects users and their ability to dance.

It first developed when hip-hop producers influenced by J Dilla and Madlib (such as Flying Lotus and Dabrye) began experimenting with dubstep & IDM elements, and around the same time dubstep producers (notably those on Hyperdub and those associated with the Purple Sound) began adding said hip-hop influences to their own productions. These two loose strands of early wonky would fuse together, resulting in the development of a fully-fledged genre during 2009.

One of the biggest and most notable wonky scenes is in Glasgow, centered around the LuckyMe collective and the Numbers. club night and label; some of the genre's most notable producers, such as Hudson Mohawke and Rustie, come from this scene. Across the Atlantic, the big names are Flying Lotus and Starkey, who coined the genre's American synonym, street bass. The Scandinavian genre of Skweee is also quite similar in sound, but has seperate roots.(by Rateyourmusic)

### Dark Ambient 黑暗氛围

Brian Enos独创的unobtrusive musical wallpaper环境音乐,，随后被温暖的室内旋律所包围。90年代，Orb给其俏皮的感觉，在一切的改变中，它发掘了风格相反的另一种音乐形式——Dark Ambient。这些音乐领域的新移民很大程度的冲击——从旧式工业和金属实验（ScornsMick Harris, Current 93s David Tibet, Nurse with Wounds Steven Stapleton）到电子研究（Kim Cascone/PGR, Psychick Warriors Ov Gaia），日本噪音乐队（K.K Null, Merzbow），和新进的独立摇滚（Main, Bark Psychosis）——黑暗氛围是以低沉的音调或是键盘弹奏的完全无规则的节拍，怪诞、令人不安的实验以及主要的吉他效果为特征的。像大部分在90年代有关电子舞曲的风格一样，它是很模糊的一种体系。许多乐队各自通过相继发表作品进入或脱离这种风格。它是和黑暗工业一起最能体现Darkwave之黑暗所在的音乐类型。CMI旗下此两类乐队无数。黑暗氛围的构型为大量厚重的氛围与人声合唱所制造的宏大浩淼的空间感觉，以Arcana,Ordo Equilibrio为体现。此外，Dark Ambient也与其他类型有所融合，如黑暗工业，以及新古典，新民谣，实验电子等。
Dark ambient is a subgenre of industrial music that features foreboding, ominous, or discordant overtones. Dark ambient has its roots in the 1970s, with the introduction of newer, smaller, and more affordable effects units, synthesizer and sampling technology. Dark ambient is an unusually diverse genre, related to ambient music and noise, yet generally free from derivatives and connections to other genres or styles

### Ambient Dub 氛围回响

氛围回响（Ambient Dub）顾名思义，即Ambient（氛围乐）和Dub（回响节拍）的组合。90年代初，英国厂牌Beyond发行了一系列有此风格特点的合辑作品，合辑名为"Ambient Dub, Volume One"、"Ambient Dub, Volume Two"等等，此风格因此得名。

特征：
氛围乐打底，配上有牙买加风味的鼓点节拍（通常会有厚实的贝斯音效），并辅助回声等电子特效制造出浓浓的迷幻感。相比较传统的牙买加雷鬼乐和后来的Dub乐，氛围回响（Ambient Dub）更强调一种冥想的效果。

流行时段：
1990年代初至今。90年代The Orb、Scorn等是此风格的代表，2000年后Deadbeat、Demdike Stare等音乐人尝试给此风格新的生命力 。(By 虾米)

英文简介：
Coined by the Beyond label for its compilation series of the same name, Ambient Dub has since been generalized by artists, critics, and audiences alike to refer to any form of rhythmic, usually beat-oriented ambient using the tastes, textures, and techniques of Jamaican dub-style production (e.g. reverb, emphasis on bass and percussion, heavy use of effects). Although the term has fallen out of favor due to the fevered intermingling of styles characteristic of post-rave electronica, it remains useful in demarcating the denser, more electronic applications of dub from the more hip-hop derived styles of downtempo, atmospheric beat music. Artists include the Orb, Higher Intelligence Agency, Sub Dub, Techno Animal, Automaton, and Solar Quest.(By Allmusic)

### Big Beat 大节拍

Big Beat是自约1997年左右兴起的音乐形态，其基本概念，就是将摇滚乐和电子乐结合起来，即是将演奏取向的摇滚乐，以电子乐方式制作，变成舞曲的形式。(不过外头也不乏以摇滚乐为主的舞会。)
　　Big Beat最明显的特征，应是它节奏的部份。Big Beat的节拍走Hip-Hop方向，但是被加重、加快很多。又重又碎的拍子，有时比Techno这类4/4拍强力机械式的舞曲更具有爆发力。因此Big Beat不只受舞曲迷欢迎，更受摇滚迷喜爱。
　　其实早在1990年The Prodigy乐团成立时，他们便有将摇滚和电子结合的概念。但当时他们的音乐电子成份还是很重，其节奏和音色的使用，可能较接近于Techno。直到1995年The Chemical Brothers的专辑Exit Planet Dust推出后，才将摇滚的部份明确化。那时乐评们称他们的音乐为Brit-Hop。很明显这个字源自于Hip-Hop，又因为The Chemical Brothers是英国团体，才使用＂Brit″这个字。（简化了British，＂英国的″之意。）
97年The Prodigy的专辑The Fat Of The Land推出之后，大家才见识到摇滚和电子结合的威力。相较于Exit Planet Dust的松散，The Fat Of The Land的制作更加成熟，节奏变得更肥厚，音色也接近于工业摇滚，更有爆发力。这张专辑更在英美两地的流行音乐榜上有非常好的成绩，表示大多数的人都很认同这种音乐，此时Big Beat这个字才正式浮现。不过这可能表示，Big Beat是电子乐中＂最不电子的一种″。 虽说The Prodigy的气势好像压过了The Chemical Brothers，但说他们是都是电子摇滚的代表，绝对不为过。电子和摇滚的结合也花了六、七年才趋于成熟。又由于Big Beat实为摇滚乐建构在电子乐上，因此也有人称它为＂Techno-Punk″。

Rescuing the electronica community from a near fall off the edge of its experimental fringe, Big Beat emerged in the mid-'90s as the next wave of big dumb dance music. Regional pockets around the world had emphasized the "less intelligent" side of dance music as early as 1994, in reaction to the growing coterie of chin-stroking intellectuals attached to the drum'n'bass and experimental movements. Big beat as a distinct movement finally coalesced in 1995-96 around two British labels: Brighton's Skint and London's Wall of Sound. The former -- home to releases by Fatboy Slim, Bentley Rhythm Ace, and Lo-Fidelity Allstars -- deserves more honors for innovation and quality, though Wall of Sound was founded slightly earlier and released great singles by Propellerheads, Wiseguys, andLes Rythmes Digitales. Big beat soon proved very popular in America as well, and artists attached to City of Angels Records (the Crystal Method, Überzone, Lunatic Calm, Front BC) gained a higher profile thanks to like-minded Brits. Other than Fatboy Slim, the other superstar artists of big beat were the Chemical Brothers and Prodigy, two groups who predated the style (and assisted its birth). Both the Chemical Brothers and Prodigy were never tight fits either, given productions that often reflected the more intelligent edge of trip-hop, and rarely broke into the mindless arena of true big beat.

The sound of big beat, a rather shameless fusion of old-school party breakbeats with appropriately off-the-wall samples, was reminiscent of house music's sampladelic phase of the late '80s as well as old-school rap and its penchant for silly samples and irresistible breaks. Though the sample programming and overall production was leaps and bounds beyond its predecessors, big beat was nevertheless criticized for dumbing down the electronica wave of the late '90s. Even while recordings by the Chemical Brothers,Prodigy, and Fatboy Slim hit the American charts and earned positive reviews -- granted, from rock critics -- worldwide, many dance fans rejected the style wholesale for being too reliant on gimmicky production values and played-out samples. Big beat lasted a surprisingly long time, given the constraints of a style reliant on the patience of listeners who've heard the same break dozens of times, as well as the patience of DJs to hunt local thrift stores to find interesting samples on old instructional records.

### Chicago House 芝加哥浩室舞曲

芝加哥浩室舞曲（Chicage House）应该算是浩室舞曲（House）的原型。它是迪斯科（Disco）退潮后的承接，也是后来各种浩室舞曲分支发展的基础。最早的浩室音乐源自于美国1980年代初期到中期。House一字是出自于芝加哥当代知名的舞厅“仓库”（Warehouse）,当时驻场DJ法兰奇‧那寇斯（Frankie Knuckles）在此播放连续的经典迪斯科可以及欧陆合成器电子音乐的混音舞曲，而舞厅的常客把他的混音作品归纳于浩室类型。

特征
芝加哥浩室舞曲代表着浩室舞曲的最基本特征：由鼓机所组成4/4拍子，伴随着厚实的低音声线（bassline）。在这层基础之上再加入各种电子乐器制造出来的声音和取样（sample），比如爵士乐、蓝调或流行电音（synth pop）。

流行时段
由于芝加哥浩室舞曲的“基础性”，它并没有像后来的某些分支大规模的流行，但它也在从1980年代中至今的任何时段都存在着。

英文简介
Chicago house generally refers to house music which was produced during the mid-1980s and late-1980s within Chicago. Chicago house is not a particular style of house music, the term is generally used to refer to the first ever house music productions, which were by Chicago-based artists in the 1980s.(by Wiki)

### Ambient House 氛围浩室舞曲

氛围浩室舞曲（Ambient House）是浩室舞曲（House）下的一个子风格。是浩室舞曲（House）和氛围音乐（Ambient）的结合。氛围浩室舞曲的出现主要是因为在1980年代末、1990年代初，在英国，当时的俱乐部音乐需求已不仅仅停留在跳舞，而是寻求一种更能让人冷静沉思的曲风。所以在当时流行的酸性浩室舞曲（Acid House）之上，The Orb、The KLF等音乐人开始将氛围音乐引入其中。

特征
氛围浩室舞曲具有传统浩室舞曲的一般特点：中速节奏、四四拍、合成器勾勒的弦乐、丰富的人声采样。新增的元素则是更具有梦幻、清冷的氛围效果。让人有一种在沉思梦境中曼舞的感觉。

流行时段
只是在1990初有过短暂的兴起，它从来没有大范围的流行，但是后来的Ambient Techno（氛围科技舞曲）、Ambient Dub(氛围回响)等曲风都以其为启发。

英文简介
Ambient house was a mostly British development in the beginning of the 1990s, employing beats, synthesizers and vocals in styles similar to House music, treated with effects that are often described as "dream-like" or "chilled out" in order to provide a more atmospheric, relaxed feel that can be compared to Ambient. While never growing into a larger scene, it provided an important stepping stone for several similar movements in the following years, including Ambient Techno, Ambient Dub, Psybient, and Progressive House. Key works include Chill Out by The KLF and the early career of close associates The Orb, e.g. The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld.(by Rateyourmusic.com)

### Chillwave 寒潮

ChillWave（冷潮）是2009年开始在美国兴起的一种独立电子风潮。很多音乐人遵循DIY精神，用一些简单的合成器等设备，用低保真的方式制作出了一些作品，并加上一些回声音效，制造出一种弛放梦幻的氛围，而其中很多作品也有梦幻流行、阳光流行、迷幻流行的味道。

### Alternative Dance 另类舞曲

另类舞曲或独立舞曲（在美国也被称为地下舞曲Alternative Dance）是一种将各种摇滚风格与电子舞曲相混合的音乐风格。曾经主要流行于英国，但通过80年代的New Order乐队和90年代的The Prodigy乐队的努力，另类舞曲已被美国乃至全世界所接受。

特征
Allmusic网站称另类舞曲在“另类和独立摇滚的歌曲结构中加入了电子节拍、合成和/或采样，和舞厅里的后迪斯科舞曲”。The Sacramento Bee报纸将其称为“后现代-欧洲合成-电子流行-新浪潮的混合”。文化历史学家Piero Scaruffi认为电子音乐最早出现于比利时，后来在加拿大，1980年至1984年之间奠定了盛行于90年代的另类舞曲的基础。

另类舞曲的灵感主要来源于舞厅文化，同时结合其他风格音乐，如合成流行乐， acid house，和trip hop。另类舞曲的表演者所创造的音乐有着显著的风格、质地、或特定音乐元素的融合。他们通常与小唱片公司签约。


二十世纪的概念

大多数另类舞曲艺术家是英国人，“因为英国舞厅和地下音乐文化中rave风格的盛行”。New Order因为在1982-93年之间所制作的音乐而被Allmusic网站视为另类舞曲风格的第一乐队，这些音乐结合了后朋克与德国乐队Kraftwerk的的电子合成流行乐风格。另类舞曲对英国80年代后期的Madchester风格（来源于曼彻斯特，New Order的家乡城市）和90年代的trip hop和rave风格有着巨大的影响。位于曼彻斯特由New Order和Factory Records唱片公司创建的The Haçienda舞厅，成为了80年代英国另类舞曲的中心。

90年代的英国还有两个突出的例子是The Prodigy和The Chemical Brothers，而在美国，芝加哥的Liquid Soud和旧金山的Dubtribe则颠覆了另类舞曲原先“以单曲为主导、没有著名而悠久的乐队的形象”。在美国，另类舞曲很少会在电台里播放，大多数创新的作品还维持其地下的状态，或还需进口。The Prodigy的第三张录音室专辑The Fat of the Land是第一张另类舞曲畅销专辑，1997年在25个国家（包括美国）销量第一。

二十一世纪的发展

随着二十一世纪初计算机技术和音乐软件的普及和进步，乐队开始放弃传统的录音室专辑制作方法。高品质的音乐往往通过一台笔记本电脑就能创造出来。这种进步导致自制的电子音乐数量有所增加，包括另类舞曲，可通过互联网下载。据BBC电台1的DJ Annie Mac称，新千年的这种现象的一部分是“社区感觉”；她指出，“网站， 博客和MySpace让人们越来越多地讨论唱片，互相推荐唱片。这不像以前的舞厅，将要流行什么都由DJ决定。口碑在现在是非常重要的。”

二十一世纪初，“Electroclash”被用来形容像Fischerspooner和Ladytron一样混合新浪潮与电子音乐的艺术家。2001年和2002年纽约举行了Electroclash节，随后2003年和2004年在美国和欧洲各地还举行了巡演。在2000年代中期，英国音乐杂志NME 通俗化了“New Rave”（“New Wave”和“Rave”）, 来形容类似Klaxons等乐队，这些乐队的摇滚审美观包括90年代的rave风格的道具如荧光棒和霓虹灯。

英文简介

Alternative dance describes artists that, while rooted firmly in Alternative Rock and Indie Rock, heavily integrate aspects of Electronic music into their songs, such as synthesizers and rhythms taken from Electronic Dance Music.

Alternative dance developed in the early 1980s with New Order's mixing of Synth Pop and Electro-Disco influence with a Post-Punk foundation. The band began to integrate Acid House into their music in the latter half of the decade, and their influence in the Manchester area gave rise to the Madchester scene in the late '80s.

Alternative dance was also used to describe acts outside of Manchester in the late 1980s and early '90s, including Primal Scream, Jesus Jones, and Saint Etienne.(by Rateyourmusic.com)

### Glitch 脉冲

Glitch字面上是指电脑或硬件设备出的小毛病，它是电子音乐的一种实验手法，主要是用一些数字器械故障所发出的声音作为录音来源，比如仪器爆破声、软件故障扭曲声、CD跳碟声、硬件噪声等等都是Glith音乐人常常喜好的。90年代初，Oval等音乐人尝试用此种声效与氛围乐结合，带动了其发展。

特征
Glitch不论是从音色还是编曲手法来说都是一种创新，它反映了当前科技时代的无所不能，遵循的是“变废为宝”的理念。广义上被置之不理的音色噪音产生了出其不意的效果。和单纯的噪音音乐天壤之别，Glitch取于噪音但没有躁动，它更阴柔温暖，富于灵性。

流行时段：
90年代初至今

英文简介
Glitch is a style of experimental Electronic music that uses the sounds created by malfunctioning digital technology - bugs, crashes, system errors, hardware noise, CD skipping, and digital distortion - as main technique of composition. This unusual method of musical creation arguably began in Germany in the early 90s, with artists like Oval combining the technique with Ambient music to help cement its place in modern electronic music history. At the other end of the Glitch spectrum, Japanese musician Yasunao Tone's use of damaged CDs created dense, extreme walls of sound, with Solo for Wounded CD perhaps being the best example. Modern glitch tends to use software to recreate these sounds, as opposed to genuinely defecting technology, and this increased ease of creation has resulted in the genre spreading out into other areas, such as Glitch Pop and Glitch Hop. (By Rateyourmusic.com)

### Hardstyle 硬派舞曲

Hardstyle是融合Hard Techno，Hardcore等曲风特点和影响所诞生的一种电子舞曲风格。 Hardstyle通常包括一个低沉，坚硬的底鼓，或者Reversed Bass，不协调的合成旋律，失真和扭曲的声音。许多Hardcore的艺术家也有涉及这曲风的制作。
Hardstyle is an electronic dance genre mixing influences from techno and hardcore. Hardstyle typically consists of a deep, hard-sounding kick drum, intense faded or reversed basslines accompanying the beat, a dissonant synth melody story telling, and detuned and distorted sounds. Many hardcore artists produce hardstyle tracks as well, and many newer Hardstyle tracks are written in compound time (for example, older Headhunterz and Noisecontrollers work).

Origins：
Hardstyle was influenced by gabber. Hardstyle has its origins in the Netherlands where artists like DJ Zany, Lady Dana, DJ Isaac, DJ Pavo, DJ Luna and The Prophet, who produced hardcore, started experimenting while playing their hardcore records. The first Hardstyle events, like Qlubtempo,took place at the beginning of the 21st century. The first few years of hardstyle were characterized by a tempo of around 140–150 BPM, a compressed kick drum sound, a short vocal sample, a screech and the use of a "reverse bass", which can be heard on the offbeat after each kick.

After several successful editions of Qlubtempo and Qlimax, Q-dance registered the word hardstyle as their brand on the 4th of July 2002.

Around 2002, more hardstyle labels emerged. Fusion (with artist as DJ Zany and Donkey Rollers) and Scantraxx (founded by Dov Elkabas) are two of the Dutch labels that started to bring out hardstyle tracks around that time.

Dubstyle
In early 2010, a new variation in hardstyle, named dubstyle was introduced. Dubstyle is the name given to the genre fusion of hardstyle and dubstep. Dubstyle tends to have reversed wobble basslines and take the kick styling of hardstyle tracks, while combining them with the rhythm, groove, and dubstep tempo and effects a fusion of elements of hardstyle with a dubstep rhythm, usually a 2-step or a breakstep rhythm.[8] Because of the sporadic beat in dubstyle, the bass is often more dragged out and/or it doesn't follow a strict offbeat pattern that regular hardstyle incorporates, which in turn results in dubstyle basslines bearing similarities to dubstep basslines.

Euphoric hardstyle
From roughly 2010 onwards, the move towards a more melodic emphasis from early hardstyle evolved into the subgenre "euphoric hardstyle", characterized by highly emotional melodies and heavy pitch-shifting of kicks.Notable euphoric hardstyle producers include Coone, Atmozfears, Sephyx, Devin Wild, D-Block & S-te-Fan (DBSTF), Da Tweekaz, Code Black, Headhunterz and Wasted Penguinz.

Raw hardstyle
Since around 2011, more terms to identify developments of hardstyle were introduced. Raw hardstyle, is a type of hardstyle influenced from Dutch hardcore or older hardstyle resulting in darker melodies, screeches and deeper-sounding kick drums. Notable raw hardstyle artists include Adaro and The Prophet.

### Hi-NRG 高能量迪斯科

Hi-NRG是电子舞曲音乐的一个子流派。
Hi-NRG这个名字是英文High Energy的简写（与其说是简写，不如说是为了让名字听起来更酷），可翻译为“高能量舞曲”。

Hi-NRG起源于英国，在80年代比较流行。它是Disco的一个变种，速度较快，不太有旋律感，不强调主唱（人声常做了电脑特效的处理而显得像机器人）。这种音乐的用途完全是为了跳舞，非常重视节拍感。
它的机械化的节拍、单调的风格对后来的House和Techno舞曲有影响。
80年代很多派别都具有类似特点，如New Order的舞曲Blue Monday也是有电子化的节拍。

### Microsound 微声

微声（Microsound）从名字可得知，是将处理对象放在更细微的，即波长周期更短的声音上。微声从字面来看是千分之一秒，但是在实际处理中，其延续时长甚至可达到十分之一秒。Microsound音乐人一般通过数字或模拟处理方式获取这些声音，并通过粒度合成（Granular Synthesis）、蒙太奇拼贴（Micromontage）的方式完成作品的架构。

特征
总的说来，Microsound和Glitch是属于“近亲”关系，都是将零碎的声音片段作为描绘作品的元素，将细碎之声融合成完整的氛围。但是Microsound因为截取的是更高频段，所以声音颗粒会比Glitch更加细碎，更加简短，更加尖锐。

英文简介
Largely defined by its own name, the term microsound largely stems from compositions built on sounds lasting no longer than a thousandth of a second, but generally can last up to a tenth of a second. A cousin to the glitch genre, microsound explores the lower and higher frequencies of the sound spectrum through digital and analog signal processing, granular synthesis, and micromontage. It focuses largely on the arrangement of sound particles within a composition.（By Allmusic）

### Minimal Techno 极简科技舞曲

极简科技舞曲（Minimal Techno）是科技舞曲（Techno）下的一个子风格。它是科技舞曲（Techno）的一种极简主义表现方式。随着浩室舞曲（House）和科技舞曲（Techno）的发展，越来越多的音乐人在其之上加入各种层次点缀。极简科技舞曲则是一次向最初简约的回归，并吸收了极简主义音乐的“渐进”美学。90年代初，一些底特律音乐人如Robert Hood和Daniel Bell将其推进。

特征
极简科技舞曲有两个特征，一个是简明性，它使用直截了当的鼓点和鲜明的合成器程式。除了保留核心结构外，将一切繁杂去除。另一个是渐进性，虽然鼓点和音色看似一成不变，但它们是仍然极为缓慢的向前推进的，从而一点一点的升华情绪。

流行时段
1990年代初至今

英文简介
When house and techno first came on the scene in the mid-'80s, productions were minimal out of necessity. As the art of sampling and programming developed, the music became more layered and professional sounding -- a progression according to some, but an unnecessary crossover move to others. Reacting against these increasingly dense productions, Minimalist Techno figures cleared their productions of most everything except pointed drum programs and stark sequencer or synthesizer patterns. Detroit figures like Rob Hood, Jeff Mills, and Plastikman led the way, with later figures including Surgeon, Oliver Ho, and Stewart Walker also contributing to the new idiom. (by Allmusic)

### Minimal Wave 极简潮

作为一个风格名，极简潮（Minimal Wave）并不是一开始就有的。2000年后，同名厂牌Minimal Wave发行了一系列此风格的回顾合辑和再版，引发了一波复兴热潮，此风格名才正式确定。简要的说，它是新浪潮（New Wave）, 冷潮（Coldwave）,合成器流行（Synth Pop）和后朋（Post-Punk）等曲风的电子极简形式。

特征：
因Minimal Wave诞生于Midi（乐器数字接口）电子技术发展之前，使用的仍是较原始的类比合成器（Analog Synthesizer）和鼓机，所以其更像业余玩家捣鼓出来的东西，有低保真的特质，没有太多花俏。人声部分不拘一格，较疏离，冷漠。

英文简介：
Minimal Wave was coined as a genre name in retrospect. It makes reference to the most electronic and minimal forms of New Wave, Coldwave, Synth Pop and Post-Punk. In its most purely electronic and synth driven form is referred as Minimal Synth. It is also named as Synth Wave and Minimal Electronics (instrumental Minimal-Synth).

In comparison to mainstream Synth-Pop the Minimal Wave sound is sparse, amateurish, stripped down and lo-fi, using analog synthesizers, drum machines and pre-MIDI electronics. The singing is unconventional, with detached/cold vocals. Minimal Wave was mainly developed during the years 1979-85, specially in Belgium, France and Germany. Most bands kept a low profile and a DIY ethic, sometimes releasing self-published cassettes or limited editions by private labels. Since the mid-2000s the interest in the genre has become more widespread, with several reissues and new releases by labels such as Minimal Wave or Anna Logue Records.(By RateYourMusic.com)

### Progressive Trance 前卫迷幻舞曲

Progressive Trance 前卫迷幻舞曲，「Prog」在这里的意思跟Progressive House的理解是一致的，意为「循序渐进」，前卫迷幻舞曲具有优美的旋律以及不断推进的段落，能够让情绪更加激昂。Progressive Trance去除了重复，循环的旋律段落，而是达到了一种更加亢奋的出神舞曲模式，更加能够感染乐迷，受到了许多乐迷的喜欢。

### Tech House 科技浩室

顾名思义，科技浩室舞曲(Tech House)即将科技舞曲(Techno)和浩室舞曲(House)的特征结合起来的一种曲风。Techno拥有钢制鼓点、粗糙扭曲的贝斯以及合成器音色，有疏离的科技冰冷感；而House则相反，它拥有鲜明的律动节拍(Groove)、温润的和声、厚实的鼓点。Tech House依然沿袭了House的基本结构，只是将House偏暖、更有灵魂的声效以及鼓点用Techno更冰冷、更扭曲、更黑暗、更深沉的特征代替，两者的结合是一种折中性的尝试。

### Witch House 女巫浩室

女巫浩室（Witch House）是2000年代末出现的一种以神秘、黑暗为主题的电子音乐类型和视觉美学。Witch House这个说法起源于本名Travis Egedy（艺名Pictureplane）的音乐人于2009年和朋友开的一个玩笑，用于描述以神秘学为核心精神的House音乐。这个原本流行于网络的词汇很快就被权威音乐媒体Pitchfork Media、博客站点以及其他主流音乐媒体为了推广音乐而大量运用，现今Witch House这个音乐标签已被Pitchfork半正式的用于描述Industrial工业音乐的一种分支。

特征
Witch House的音乐一般融合了美国得克萨斯州休斯敦市的音乐厂牌Swishahouse所做的嘻哈音乐的一些技术特点：慵懒的速率加上跳拍、停顿的节拍，加上一些来自noise, drone, shoegaze这些音乐类型的元素。Witch House还受到了1980年代哥特乐队的影响，包括Cocteau Twins, The Cure, Christian Death和Dead Can Dance等乐队。Witch House同时还有强烈的早期工业音乐的影子。这种音乐风格的音乐人发布了不少流行和说唱歌曲的慢速度版本混音，或是把不同的歌很明显的放慢以后做成时间较长的混音歌曲。这种音乐类型的艺人和歌曲名常常使用三角形、十字架形或是其他几何图形命名（例如▲,▼,∆, †），原因包括他们独特的审美风格以及一些艺人希望将这种音乐保持地下，不想轻易在网上被找到。

时至2011年8月2日，Pitchfork Media始终在使用这个音乐类型术语，但主要用于推广美国另类金属乐队Deftones主唱兼吉他手Chino Moreno的个人音乐作品†††，他的单曲EP唱片Crosses集合了极简主义、温和的、以电子音乐为基调氛围摇滚曲目，这使得这种模糊、难定义的音乐类型更加富有争议性。（by 猴头姑）

Witch house is an occult-themed dark electronic music genre and visual aesthetic that emerged in late 2000s. The music is heavily influenced by chopped and screwed hip-hop, dark ambient soundscapes, industrial and noise experimentation, and features use of synthesizers, drum machines, obscure samples, droning repetition and heavily altered, ethereal, indiscernible vocals. Witch house visual aesthetic includes occult, witchcraft, shamanism and horror-inspired artworks, collages and photographs as well as significant use of typographic elements such as Unicode symbols.Many works by witch house visual artists incorporate themes from 60s, 70s and 80s cult and obscure horror movies,the television series Twin Peaks,and mainstream pop culture celebrities. Common typographic elements in artist and track names include triangles, crosses, and other Unicode symbols, which are seen by some as a method of keeping the scene underground and harder to search for on the Internet.

### 2-Step 二步舞曲

二步舞曲（2-Step）是英国车库舞曲（UK Garage）最典型的发展方向之一。相对于英国车库舞曲，二步舞曲有两个明显的特征：一个是将前者稳定的四四拍变成游离的、不规则的碎拍；另一个是融入了更多灵魂乐（Soul）、节奏布鲁斯（R&B）等元素，让其更有都市感。所以也有一些此类风格的作品登上了流行榜单。

英文简介

One of the primary characteristics of the 2-step sound – the term being coined to describe "a general rubric for all kinds of jittery, irregular rhythms that don't conform to garage's traditional four-on-the-floor pulse"– is that the rhythm lacks the kick drum pattern found in many other styles of electronic music with a regular four-on-the-floor beat. A typical 2-step drum pattern features a kick on the first and third beat, with a shuffled rhythm or the use of triplets applied to other elements of the percussion, creating a "lurching, falter-funk feel", and resulting in a beat distinctly different from that present in other house or techno. Although tracks with only two kick drum beats to a bar are perceived as being slower than the traditional four-on-the-floor beat, the listener's interest is maintained by the introduction of unusual snare placements and accents in the drum patterns, or scattered rimshots and woodblocks, as well as syncopated basslines and the percussive use of other instruments such as pads and strings.

Instrumentation usually includes keyboards, synthesizers and drum machines. Other instruments added to expand the musical palette include guitar, piano and horns; these additions are almost always sampled.[citation needed] The primarily synth-based basslines used in 2-step are similar to those in the style's progenitors such as UK garage and before that, drum and bass and jungle, but influences from funk and soul can also be heard. Vocals in 2-step garage are usually female, and similar to the style prevalent in house music or contemporary R&B.Some 2-step producers also process and cut up elements of an a cappella vocal and use it as an element of the track. Much like other genres derived from UK garage, MCs are often featured, particularly in a live context, with a vocal style reminiscent of oldschool jungle.

Influences from hip hop and drum and bass, particularly the hardstep and techstep subgenres have also been noted by critics. The fact that the scene had a significantly different atmosphere to those that surrounded precursors with less aggression at live events was also noted by some critics.

### Acid House 酸性浩室舞曲

酸性浩室舞曲（Acid House）是浩室舞曲（House）下的一个子风格。顾名思义，它在之前的芝加哥浩室舞曲（Chicago House）之上加入更具有酸性（Acid）的迷幻味道。在1980年代中期浩室舞曲火热的芝加哥，一些DJ尝试将Roland TB-303合成器的音效加入其中，这种迷幻效果和当时俱乐部的药物文化很好的吻合了。后来这种曲风传到大洋彼岸的英国，迅速进入主流排行榜。

特征
酸性浩室舞曲具有传统浩室舞曲的一般特点：中速节奏、四四拍、合成器勾勒的弦乐、丰富的人声采样。新增的元素则是Roland TB-303合成器带来的支离破碎的贝斯音效，在跳舞中也同时给人一种嗑药般的迷幻感觉。

流行时段
1990年代初短暂盛行，后来逐渐被锐舞音乐（Rave Music）代替。

英文简介
Acid house is a sub-genre of house music that emphasizes a repetitive, hypnotic and trance-like style, often with samples or spoken lines instead of lyrics. Acid house's core electronic squelch sounds were developed around the mid-1980s, particularly by DJs from Chicago who experimented with the Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. Acid house spread to the United Kingdom and continental Europe, where it was played by DJs in the acid house and later rave scenes. By the late 1980s, copycat tracks and acid house remixes brought the style into the mainstream, where it had some influence on pop and dance styles.Nicknamed "the sound of acid",acid house's influence on dance music is tangible considering the sheer number of electronic music tracks referencing acid house through the use of its sounds, including trance, Goa Trance, psytrance, breakbeat, big beat, techno, trip-hop and house music.(by Wiki)

### Bass House 贝斯浩室

Bass House(贝斯浩室)成型于2010年左右的Bass House发展至今仍是一个独特的存在，最初起源于英国，毕竟英国人玩音乐喜欢从Bass作为切入点从而玩出各种花样。说它特殊是因为严格意义上来定位的话Bass House既不属于电音的”Bass系”也不属于”House系”，一切源于其组合成分；Bass House其实是Bass Music（Trap/Dubstep/DNB等）与House Music（Techno/Trance/House等）的融合 ，具体来讲我们可以模拟一个等式，即Bass House=Electro House+Future House+Brostep/Trap

如果说Future House是以Deep House为底板，那么basshouse它则以Future House为模板，Bass House有时也会被听众混淆认为是Future House，Bass House是个让人亢奋躁动的电音风格绝对炸到无法接受
如今basshouse这种风格越来越受到各位电音爱好者的喜欢！我相信再不久，basshouse会引领一股新的热潮

风格感谢@Evephy-Z @不听摇滚的你

### Big Room House 炸房浩室

Big Room House（Big Room）是Electro House（电气浩室）的一个子分类，也是当下最受欢迎的电子舞曲风格之一。炸房浩室是受Progressive House，Tech House，以及Trance影响而衍生的风格，除了浩室音乐标准4/4拍的特点，有一段非常长的Rise的Build-Up，整体没有花哨的旋律，震撼的合成器效果，极简的听感非常容易带起现场的气氛。像是Martin Garrix，Hardwell，Nicky Romero都加入了Big Room类舞曲的制作人行列。

Big room house is a subgenre of electro house. Since the mid-2010s it has become one of the most popular forms of electronic dance music. It is regarded as a combination of hard dance and electro techno.It has gained mainstream popularity after artists like Hardwell, Nicky Romero and Martin Garrix began infusing it into their musical style.

The genre is generally 126 to 132 bpm.It is composed of 'lengthy techno-influenced build-ups, a powerful and driving electro-style drop'. It is also known to include a 4/4 hardstyle kick. A typical big room house track features bass-heavy kicks, with minimal musical elements and sometimes only a syncopated supersaw or percussion.It often incorporates drops, minimalist percussion, regular beats, sub-bass layered kicks, simple melodies, and synth-driven distorted breakdowns.

### Disco 迪斯科

迪斯科（英文：Disco)，来自法语的discothèque，意指那些播放录制好的跳舞音乐的舞厅。舞蹈是来源于美国黑人民间舞蹈和爵士舞。近几年在世界，特别是欧洲风靡一时的伴舞音乐，节奏是混合了爵士乐、摇滚乐以及拉丁美洲音乐的某些节奏特点。

与摇滚相比，它的特点是强劲的、不分轻重的、像节拍器一样作响的4/4拍子，歌词和曲调简单。

1977年，因澳大利亚流行音乐小组“比吉斯”（Bee Gees）的电影录音《周末狂热》在美国掀起迪斯科热。迪斯科经常在录音室进行音响合成，制成唱片，但终因节奏单调、风格雷同，于80年代初逐渐被其他节奏不那么显著、速度稍慢的流行舞曲所代替。

Disco marked the dawn of the modern era of dance-based popular music. Growing out of the increasingly groove-oriented sound of early '70s and funk, disco emphasized the beat above anything else, even the singer and the song. Disco was named after discotheques, clubs that played nothing but music for dancing. Most of the discotheques were gay clubs in New York, and the DJs in these clubs specifically picked soul and funk records that had a strong, heavy groove. After being played in the disco, the records began receiving radio play and respectable sales. Soon, record companies and producers were cutting records created specifically for discos. Naturally, these records also had strong pop hooks, so they could have crossover success. Disco albums frequently didn't have many tracks — they had a handful of long songs that kept the beat going. Similarly, the singles were issued on 12-inch records, which allowed for extended remixes. DJs could mix these tracks together, matching the beats on each song since they were marked with how fast they were in terms of beats per minute. In no time, the insistent, pounding disco beat dominated the pop chart, and everyone cut a disco record, from rockers like the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart to pop acts like the Bee Geesand new wave artists like Blondie. There were disco artists that became stars — Donna Summer, Chic, the Village People, and KC & the Sunshine Band were brand names — but the music was primarily a producer's medium, since they created the tracks and wrote the songs. Disco lost momentum as the '70s became the '80s, but it didn't die — it mutated into a variety of different dance-based genres, ranging from dance-pop and hip-hop to house and techno.

### Electro (Electro-Funk) 放克电子

Electro音乐混入了70年代的funk、80年代早期的合成器技术，它是种很纯的靠电子合成器来制造的音乐。90年代中期成熟了得electro音乐正是闯入了底特律和英国，非常独立的一个音乐类型，却有很多其它音乐的元素

Blending '70s funk with the emerging hip-hop culture and synthesizer technology of the early '80s produced the style known alternately as Electro. But what seemed to be a brief fad for the public -- no more than two or three hits, including Afrikaa Bambaataa's "Planet Rock" and Grandmaster Flash's "The Message," neither of which made the pop Top 40 -- was in fact a fertile testing ground for innovators who later diverged into radically different territory, including Dr. Dre (who worked with the World Class Wreckin' Cru) and techno godfather Juan Atkins (with Cybotron). Electro also provided an intriguing new direction for one of the style's prime influences: Herbie Hancock, whose 1973 Headhunters album proved a large fusion hit, came storming back in 1983 with the electro single "Rockit." Despite its successes (documented in full on Rhino's four-disc Electric Funk set), the style was quickly eclipsed by the mid-'80s rise of hip-hop music built around samples (often from rock records) rather than musical synthesizers. Nevertheless, many techno and dance artists continued harking back to the sound, and a full-fledged electro revival emerged in Detroit and Britain during the mid-'90s.

### Electronic/Electronica 电子

随着时代的演进，音乐家有了更多制作音乐的方法。所谓电子音乐，就是以电子合成器，音乐软体，电脑等所产生的电子声响来制作音乐。电子音乐范围广泛，生活周遭常常能听到，在电影配乐，广告配乐，甚至某些国语流行歌中都有用到，不过以电子舞曲为最。很多人认为电子乐是一种冷冰冰，没有感情的音乐。其实电子乐也可融入Rock、 Jazz甚至Blues等多种元素而充满情感的。

从广义上来说，电子乐（Electronica）这个词可以指很多的音乐类型，因为电子乐器的使用变的越来越普遍了，而且很多80年代后期的跳舞音乐都是电子的。然而，通常电子乐是指当它刚成形时艺术家们通过电子设备所探索出的各种独一无二的声响，以及后人们所创造出的继承这些先驱们的作品。前卫作曲家们长时间的着迷于利用先进的技术手段，创造那些前所未有的电子声响。法国作曲家Edgard Vare是这个领域的一个先驱，早在上世纪20年代就发明了自己的电子乐设备，50年代一直在实验磁带延时技术。Vare的工作极大的影响了美国前卫艺术家John Cage和德国作曲家Karheinz Stockhausen，后两位极大的扩展了电子乐的曲式结构。然而，直到上世纪70年代，音序器和合成器变得越来越便宜和 简便时，电子乐才真正的进入大众的视野。1968年，Wendy Carlos发行了一张带有迷幻性质的Bach专辑，使用Moog合成器实现了Bach的一些音乐片断。这张专辑在公众中引起了极大的反响，Stockhausen对电子乐器的推广也在德国引起了实验音乐的风潮——Krautrock(德国摇滚)。诸如Can和Neu!等乐队开始将合成器和磁带机的使用带入他们的实验，但是这场风潮中最重要的乐队还是Kraftwerk和Tangerine Dream(橙梦)。

Kraftwerk开创了在pop中使用合成器的新观念，他们机器人般的，机械的，催眠性的形式极大的影响了20世纪几乎所有的电子乐。同时，Tangerine Dream受到简约古典作曲技法的启发Kraftwerk乐队，创造了一种称为space的音乐形式，顾名思义，这是一种氛围舒缓的， 曰没惚的音乐。其他重要的艺人还包括Klaus Schulze，他探索了比space还要迷幻的音乐形式；Brain Eno，对于电子元素在pop中的应用有着创造性的发明和实验，可是他最出名还是他的ambient music(氛围音乐)——一种依靠合成器创造出某种环境的音乐类型。

Ambient和space音乐引发了后来的new age(新世纪)，后者强调的是一种安宁的，平和的，深邃的氛围并且旋律及其优美。Progressive electronic(激进电子乐)是new age的一个分支，它表现的是一种更加戏剧化，管弦乐使用更多的形式，从而打破了电子乐根基中的简约风格。此外，诸如synth-pop，techno和 electronica等音乐形式也都在早期的电子乐基础上有了很大的创新。

Reaching back to grab the grooves of '70s disco/funk and the gadgets of electronic composition, Electronica soon became a whole new entity in and of itself, spinning off new sounds and subgenres with no end in sight two decades down the pike. Its beginnings came in the post-disco environment of Chicago/New York and Detroit, the cities who spawned house and techno (respectively) during the 1980s. Later that decade, club-goers in Britain latched onto the fusion of mechanical and sensual, and returned the favor to hungry Americans with new styles like jungle/drum'n'bass and trip-hop. Though most all early electronica was danceable, by the beginning of the '90s, producers were also making music for the headphones and chill-out areas as well, resulting in dozens of stylistic fusions like ambient-house, experimental techno, tech-house, electro-techno, etc. Typical for the many styles gathered under the umbrella was a focus on danceable grooves, very loose song structure (if any), and, in many producers, a relentless desire to find a new sound no matter how tepid the results.

### Experimental Dub 实验回响

ousands of miles away from sunny Jamaica, a loose collective of Berlin producers jump-started the style of music known as Experimental Dub. If the scene was centered at all, it occurred at Hard Wax Records, a record store as well as a tight distribution company that was home to several of the style's crucial labels (Basic Channel, Chain Reaction, Imbalance) and producers (Maurizio, Mark Ernestus, Porter Ricks, Pole, Monolake). Indebted to Chicago acid house and minimalist Detroit techno figures like Jeff Mills, Rob Hood, and Plastikman, experimental dub was rather easily characterized; the sound usually focused on a mix of crackling, murky atmospheres that sounded almost subaquatic, with a midtempo beat and strong, clanging percussion. The similarities to classic Jamaican dub producers King Tubby and Lee "Scratch" Perry were indirect at best, but the term worked well for identifying the signature sound of many of Germany's best experimental producers. Other than the Basic Channel camp, experimental dub's most important figures were Mike Ink (aka Wolfgang Voigt) and Thomas Brinkmann. Ink, a longtime Berlin producer responsible for more than a half-dozen aliases and labels, did most of his important work on the Profan and Studio 1 labels. Brinkmann, a comparative newcomer to the style, earned praise for his remixes of material by Ink and Plastikman. Experimental dub, in turn, inspired several major techno figures (including Plastikman and Mills) by the late '90s, and its influence was even seen in American indie rock and post-rock.

### Grime 污垢舞曲

Grime最早出现在2000年初，发源于英国伦敦，是伦敦本土的地下音乐。这种音乐是由早期的英国电子音乐风格发展而来，包括UK Garage和Jungle，同时也受到牙买加Dancehall、Ragga和Hiiphop的影响。这种音乐风格的特点是快节奏、切分音碎拍，并且伴有强硬生涩的电子音色，BPM大约在130到140左右。

与时下流行的Trap不同，Grime的主题比Trap要深刻得多，歌词的内容通常都是对时下热点问题的尖锐批判。Wiley 于 2002 年发布的单曲《Eskimo》标志着 Grime 以独立乐种的身份正式诞生。其将 Garage、Dancehall、Jungle 音乐与 Drum / Bass 元素相糅其中，并散发着一股黑暗、躁动、不可一世的力量，「反主流文化运动」成为它最明显的标签。此外，140bpm 是 Grime 最具辨识度的节奏。

### Industrial music 工业音乐

“工业”这个词作为一种音乐形式及风格出现并发展于20世纪后半叶，伴随着当时文化思潮而存在。任何一种风格都是受环境影响而诞生的，正应了那句话：“环境铸造人”，什么样的环境决定什么样的艺术家，什么样的艺术家决定什么样的音乐，工业最为典型。
工业音乐产生于20世纪70年代，于80年代得到长足发展，90年代至今分化融解。当时的欧美人文思潮推崇未来主义、达达主义和超现实主义，又正是信息化与产业化成熟的阶段，更赶上工业化(这里用的是本义)流水线式的生产结构基本成熟，于是工业音乐应运而生。尤其第三点，很形象解释了此种风格诞生的原因和起源，正如“哥特”音乐的本质来源于古典、取材于诞生于欧洲中世纪教会统治时期哥特建筑一样。所以说，音乐的形成是历史文化的体现。

Industrial music is a style of experimental music that draws on transgressive and provocative themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by the band Throbbing Gristle, and the creation of the slogan "industrial music for industrial people". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. Allmusic defines industrial as the "most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music"; "initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation". 
The first industrial artists experimented with noise and aesthetically controversial topics, musically and visually, such as fascism, serial killers and the occult. Their production was not limited to music, but included mail art, performance art, installation pieces and other art forms. Prominent industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, SPK, Boyd Rice, Cabaret Voltaire, and Z'EV. The precursors that influenced the development of the genre included acts such as electronic group Kraftwerk, experimental rock acts such as The Velvet Underground and Frank Zappa, psychedelic rock artists such as Jimi Hendrix, and composers such as John Cage. Musicians also cite writers such as William S. Burroughs, and philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche as influences.
While the term was initially self-applied by a small coterie of groups and individuals associated with Industrial Records in the 1970s, it broadened to include artists influenced by the original movement or using an "industrial" aesthetic. These artists expanded the genre by pushing it into noisier and more electronic directions. Over time, its influence spread into and blended with styles including ambient and rock, all of which now fall under the post-industrial music label. Electro-industrial music is a primary sub-genre that developed in the 1980s. The two other most notable hybrid genres are industrial rock and industrial metal, which include bands such as Nine Inch Nails and Ministry, both of which released platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. These three genres are often referred to as simply industrial.

### Minimal Synth 极简合成器

In its most common form Minimal Synth is entirely based on analog synthesizers and drum machines.

Minimal Synth golden era was from late 1970s to mid 1980s, obviously it never was aimed for MTV/VH1 play and has remained underground. The genre is characterised by dark and moody tones. It has a bleak stripped down sound, with raw analog synths, a pulsating drum beat, and cold/detached vocals. This same sort of music without the vocals is also referred to as Minimal Electronics.

Minimal Synth records tend to show a DIY quality, some are pretty experimental when compared to other forms of pop music. The overarching genre of most early '80s synth pop is New Wave, the same applies for minimal synth, the umbrella genre is New Wave in its minimal form: Minimal Wave. The Minimal Synth features explained in this description are often favoured by dark wavers and the avant-garde pop and electronic music fans.

Many Minimal Synth records were released in very limited quantities at the time, so have become collectors’ items and 7"s can go for several hundred dollars at online auction sites. Even current acts, such as The Phone and Jonni Mogul, and releases by labels such as Attractive! Co-ordinates and Anna Logue Records are increasingly sought after.

Some examples of influential artists are John Foxx, Kraftwerk, Visage, Brian Eno, YMO, The Human League, David Bowie, and Soft Cell. Some noteworthy minimal synth artists include: Nini Raviolette, Jeff & Jane Hudson, ADN' Ckrystall, Guyer's Connection, The Short Wave Mystery, Oviformia-SCI and Napalm Babies.

### Nu-Disco 新迪斯科

Nu-disco or nu-house is a 21st-century dance music genre associated with a renewed interest in 1970s and early 1980s disco, early to mid-1980s italo disco and boogie, and the synthesizer-heavy Euro disco and P-Funk aesthetics.

The moniker appeared in print as early as 2002, and by mid-2008 was used by record shops such as the online retailers Juno and Beatport. These vendors often associate it with re-edits of original-era disco music, as well as with music from European producers who make dance music inspired by original-era American disco, electro and other genres popular in the late ′70s and early ′80s. It is also used by Beatport, to describe the music on several American labels that were previously associated with the genres electroclash and french house.

In 2002, The Independent described nu-disco as the result of applying "modern technology and pin-sharp production" to ′70s disco and funk. In 2008, Beatport described nu-disco as "everything that springs from the late 1970s and early 1980s (electronic) disco, boogie, cosmic, Balearic and Italo disco continuum," while Spin magazine placed an umlaut over the "u" in "nu", used the term interchangeably with Eurodisco, and cited strong Italo disco as well as electroclash influences.

Nu-disco is most popular in Europe and Australia. Bands such as Miami Horror, Cut Copy, Cadillac and Bag Raiders epitomize the Australian nu-disco sound. The French disco-revival sound can be seen in big acts such as Daft Punk, Stardust, Modjo, Madeon, Breakbot, Justice, Chromeo, as well as Duck Sauce, Armand Van Helden's collaborative project with A-Trak. While the latter may qualify more as an electro band, their walking bass lines and funk rhythms (as seen especially in "I Want Your Soul") are reminiscent of the genre.

### Post-Disco 后迪斯科

在2011年早期，后回响贝斯（Post-Dubstep）被用来形容被回响贝斯（Dubstep）影响的当代流行音乐。这些作品借鉴了Dubstep的一些制作手法，比如浑厚的贝斯节拍。以及UK garage、2-step和其他跳舞音乐的特点。此领域的音乐人也会尝试将氛围音乐和2000年后复兴的R&B元素融入其中。另外，Post-Dubstep还有个很鲜明的特点：它的节拍一般在每分钟130拍左右。

Mount Kimbie、Fantastic Mr Fox和James Blake等音乐人是此风格的代表音乐人。2010年后兴起的Future Garage、Witch House等风格也常被视为Post-Dubstep运动的分支。

In early 2011 the term "post-dubstep" was used to describe urban music that was influenced by certain aspects of dubstep.The breadth of styles that have come to be associated with the term post-dubstep preclude it from being a specific musical genre. Pitchfork writer Martin Clark has suggested that "well-meaning attempts to loosely define the ground we're covering here are somewhat futile and almost certainly flawed. This is not one genre. However, given the links, interaction, and free-flowing ideas ... you can't dismiss all these acts as unrelated"Such music often references earlier dubstep productions as well as UK garage, 2-step and other forms of underground electronic dance music.Artists producing music that has been described as post-dubstep have also incorporated elements of ambient music and early 2000s (decade) R&B. The latter in particular is heavily sampled by three artists described as post-dubstep: Mount Kimbie, Fantastic Mr Fox and James Blake.The tempo of music typically characterised as post-dubstep is approximately 130 beats per minute.
The production duo Mount Kimbie is often associated with the origination of the term post-dubstep.The commercially popular band The xx's Jamie xx has released remixes which are considered post-dubstep, including We're New Here (2011), a Gil Scott-Heron remix album.

### Rave Music 锐舞音乐

锐舞的英文RAVE，原为一群人聚众热闹之意。后来它代表着在Disco-Jockey（DJ）打碟号召之下，打扮入时的年轻人，沉醉于DJ播放的新派跳舞音乐中，通宵达旦，热烈起舞。

1988年，4位英国DJ去西班牙度假岛屿阿利巴里群岛时发现了BALEARIC音乐风格，当地DJ如阿尔费多将来自芝加哥的HOUSE舞曲加入多种西班牙及其他音乐元素播放出来，再加上IBIZAE文化的刺激。让以保罗奥克福得为首的4人享受了极为精彩的一夜。回到英国他们决定要将这种派对搬回家乡，这就是RAVEPARTY（锐舞派对）的源头。

从丹尼.兰普里搞的SHOOMPARTY开始，从起始的ACIDHOUSE音乐播放开始，跳舞文化从此掀开了新的一页，随着英国众多优秀俱乐部、DJ、派对搞手的出现，这种青年次文化也让大家的想象空间无限扩大，为数码时代的年青人带来了他们最需要的精神食粮。
实际上，在同时间的欧洲，大部分年青人亦全是“蒲友”，意大利、比利时、荷兰、法国更是创造了自己的独特音乐风格，意大利的口水舞曲制作堪称世界第一，比利时、法国是欧洲新锐舞文化的核心地带，荷兰的HARDCORE舞曲让你一次颠个够，不过欧洲最厉害的是德国，首先它差不多成为了欧洲的TECHNO之都，德国人爱TECHNO的程度，可以比英国人有过之而无不及。1992年，在SVANVATH、JAMANANDSPOON的带领下，德国TRANCE成了全球跳舞新势力，而柏林每年一度的LOVEPARADE亦愈演愈烈，最近4年，来自全世界的蒲友每次都超过100万人，令柏林成为全球最有人气的锐舞中心。

亚洲地区的派对近年来愈发丰富。首先是泰国，曼谷本身已有一个不错的跳舞音乐环境，可万人的焦点集中在KOHSAMUI上，那儿的蒲友将源自印度岛屿GOA的圆月沙滩派对移师到泰国，想像一下，在圆月的沙滩上大跳特跳锐舞的心情，绝对终生难忘。

### Synthwave 合成器潮

Synthwave is a form of Electronic music that takes most of its inspiration from synth music and pop culture from the 1980s. Musically, synthwave is often instrumental and has a "futuristic" theme, with large, throbbing, retro synths. House influenced heavy drums (often side-chained) are also very popular. It draws inspiration from a variety of genres that originated and/or was most popular during the 1980s, including, but not limited to, Synth Pop, Progressive Electronic, Italo-Disco, Electro-Disco and other derivative styles. Synthwave albums are generally arranged in a style that is similar to a Film Soundtrack, Film Score, Television Music or Video Game Music album. The visual element of synthwave is important as well. Album covers are heavily influenced by 1980s films (especially Science Fiction and Action movies, such as Blade Runner or The Terminator), TV shows (specifically Miami Vice and Knight Rider), video games (notably OutRun and similar titles), and other elements important in 1980s culture.

The origins of synthwave can be traced back to French Electro House scene in the mid-2000s. Artists such as Kavinsky combined House music with elements of 1980s Electronic music, complete with 1980s inspired artwork. Soon after, several French producers, such as College, Anoraak and Minitel Rose began producing similar styled music. There have also been some synthwave soundtracks, such as Drive and Hotline Miami.

Since then, many record labels have been set up dedicated to this sound (the most important being the French label Valerie, American label Italians Do It Better Records, and the Canadian label Rosso Corsa Records), and a slew of producers have emerged from around the world, as the scene continues to flourish.

Also known as: UK Bass Music, Future Bass
UK Bass is a loose term used for certain stylistic developments in British dance music, arising from Dubstep and UK Funky in 2009 and 2010. It includes a strong emphasis on bass and sub-bass, but tends to experiment with the structure and format, as well as variations of the bpm. Influences from other genres, such as Juke, Footwork, Techno, House, UK Garage, Contemporary R&B and Wonky, are frequently repurposed and filtered through a Dubstep and UK Funky sound. The result is a varied range of sounds that stretches or breaks the barriers for the latter genres.

Labels such as Night Slugs, Numbers., Hessle Audio, and Swamp 81, as well as DJs like Ben UFO, Oneman, and Pearson Sound, have been influential in popularizing this style.
