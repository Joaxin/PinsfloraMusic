实验音乐是对任何推动现有的音乐边界线和流派定义的一种普遍的分类，像在摇滚，爵士，现代合成或其他的风格。当一个音乐家或作曲家接近一种全异风格的混合物或是合成非正统的，新的，明显独特的成分，这种音乐都可以被分类成实验音乐。

## Experimental 实验音乐

试验音乐是对任何推动现有的音乐边界线和流派定义的一种普遍的分类，像在摇滚，爵士，现代合成或其他的风格。当一个音乐家或作曲家接近一种全异风格的混合物或是合成非正统的，新的，明显独特的成分。
实验音乐，是指一种有别于传统音乐和流行音乐的新式音乐类型，最早起源于20世纪中后期的北美地区。长期以来，实验音乐会被一部份一般的音乐人责难偏离音乐的传统规范，指其为噪音或不符常理。
“实验音乐”定义较为松散，并不指某种固定的音乐模式。实验音乐汇合多种流派的音乐，可以是完全不同风格的音乐的混合体，可以是采用新技术（尤其是电脑技术）制作的非正统音乐、电子音乐，或是一种鲜明独特的音乐风格；实验音乐有时也可以用来形容跨种族的混合音乐风格。
实验音乐追求纯粹的、不带任何意义的聆听，如森林中的鸟兽鱼虫所发出的声音、电脑音乐家制作的“听程式逻辑在跑的声音”、甚至某个路段的录音，在实验音乐人看来，其本质都是对声音的最高礼拜。

Avant-Garde is taken from the French for "vanguard," which is the part of the armed forces that always stands at the front of the rest of the army. In the case of music, the avant-garde are those individuals who take music to the next step in development or at least take music on a divergent path. The term was first applied only after World War II. In popular idioms it is a term used to describe or refer to free jazz movements but the meaning remains the same: techniques of expression that are new, innovative and radically different from the tradition or the mainstream. Wagner and Debussy can easily be classified as avant-garde relevant to their time but the term did not enter familiar usage until the advent of Stockhausen.

## Free Improvisation 自由即兴

自由即兴音乐代表了前卫音乐人对彻底的、不妥协姿态的创作自由追求的顶点。即兴意味着毫无准备之下的演绎，意味着要在当时当地即时创作音乐。
即兴不是新鲜事物：古典音乐作曲家（如Mozart）便是技艺高超的即兴表演者。自由即兴音乐则让音乐艺人随心所欲，置任何规条于不顾，节奏、和声、旋律，甚至对乐器自身的物理完整性的尊重，全都被粉碎。“自由即兴”表演者通过他的乐器和演奏传达出自己的创造力，与可能给人的仿佛印象相比，自由即兴演绎实际上要艰难许多，它要求大量的音乐和心理上的训练，因为音乐人必须达到一种高水平的专注力，一种将自己赤裸裸地表现在观众面前的能力，如果不是单独表演（也不想被孤立的话），他还需要聆听他人的即兴，以便与之互动。


Free improvisation represents the culmination of the avant-gardist musician¹s quest for complete, uncompromised freedom. To improvise means to perform without preparation, to make music on the spot. Improvising is nothing new: classical composers like Mozart were accomplished improvisers. But free improvisation lets the musician do whatever he wants, regardless of any rule. Rhythm, harmony, melody, even respect for the physical integrity of the instrument itself (preparations and home-built instruments are often used) are shattered. The free improviser channels his creative energy through his instrument and plays. A lot harder than it may seem, free improvising requires extensive musical and psychological training, as the musician must attain a high level of concentration, an ability to metaphorically strip naked in front of the audience, and if he is not performing alone, to listen to the other improvisers in order to interact with them if he doesn¹t want to get isolated. Free improvisers come from very diverse backgrounds -- jazz (Cecil Taylor, Derek Bailey), rock (Thurston Moore), electronica (Fennesz, Jim O'Rourke, Voice Crack), even classical (Patrick Scheyer, Aki Takase) -- and perform in settings ranging from solo to large groups called creative orchestras.

Free improvisation is not the same as free jazz, although some key musicians like Bailey and Taylor came from such a background. Free jazz often remained anchored in its originating idiom, using heads and licks to structure the improvised material. There is no such thing in free improvisation -- being freed of all rules, it cannot be traced back to a genre other than the very generic term "avant-garde." As a style, free improv started to emerge in the late 1960s, mainly on the Berlin and London scenes, when people like Peter Brötzmann and the musicians revolving around (and trained by) John Stevens started to push American free jazz into more abstract territories. Brötzmann¹s 1968 LP Machine Gun shattered the world of free jazz and pioneered a form of improv characterized by extreme energy levels. Around Stevens and his Spontaneous Music Ensemble, a group of musicians developed an approach to improvisation relying on listening, toning down, trying to "become" the other musicians while being oneself, instead of attempting to outplay the other participants. This school of free improv is best exemplified by the productions released on the record label Emanem. In the late 1990s/early 2000s, an even more radical approach to free improvisation emerged, based on silence and the use of very short, very fragmented musical gestures. People like John Butcher, Axel Dörner, Franz Hautzinger and Radu Malfatti first explored these extremes.

## Noise 噪音

就像这种音乐名字所启示的那样，噪音是泥泞的，生硬粗暴的，使人精疲力竭的。它为了开拓声波的攻击性，几乎完全摈弃了旋律和作曲技巧。从来自日本的Merzbow震耳欲聋，牙齿霍霍的攻击，到Amphetamine Reptile厂牌下乐队Tar 和Vertigo厚重，碾压式的紧张感，这是一种黑暗和残忍的音乐，将摇滚乐推向最远的极致。到了90年代末，50年代具象音乐中开创的正弦波死灰复燃，大批音乐家采用这种元素进行创作，比如大友良英。

Sludgy, abrasive, and punishing, Noise is everything its name promises, expanding on the music's capacity for sonic assault while almost entirely rejecting the role of melody and songcraft. From the ear-splitting, teeth-rattling attack of Japan's Merzbow to the thick, grinding intensity of Amphetamine Reptile-label bands like Tar and Vertigo, it's dark, brutal music that pushes rock to its furthest extremes. By the end of the '90s, a resurgence in the use of sine waves -- originally explored by musique concrète artists in the '50s -- became increasingly frequent among noise artists such as Otomo Yoshihide.

## Field Recordings 自然采样

自然采样是指离开录音室，在此之外的地方录下各种声音。
Field recording is the term used for an audio recording produced outside of a recording studio.
Field recordings can be either of two varieties. Field recording of natural sounds, also called phonography (a term chosen to illustrate its similarities to photography), was originally developed as a documentary adjunct to research work in the field and foley work for film. With the introduction of high-quality portable recording equipment, it has subsequently become an evocative artform in itself. In the 1970s both processed and natural phonographic recordings (pioneered by the Environments series) became popular.
"Field recordings" may also refer to simple monaural or stereo recordings taken of musicians in familiar and casual surroundings, such as the ethnomusicology recordings pioneered by John Lomax, Nonesuch Records and Vanguard Records.

## Sound Collage 声效拼贴

In music, montage (literally "putting together") or sound collage ("gluing together") is a technique where sound objects or compositions, including songs, are created from collage, also known as montage, the use of portions of previous recordings or scores. This is often done through the use of sampling, while some playable sound collages were produced by gluing together sectors of different vinyl records. Like its visual cousin, the collage work may have a completely different effect than that of the component parts, even if the original parts are completely recognizable or from only one source.

## Drone 蜂鸣

In music, a drone is a harmonic or monophonic effect or accompaniment where a note or chord is continuously sounded throughout most or all of a piece. The word drone is also used to refer to any part of a musical instrument that is just used to produce such an effect.
A drone effect can be achieved through a sustained sound or through repetition of a note. It most often establishes a tonality upon which the rest of the piece is built. A drone can be instrumental, vocal or both.

## Spoken Word 诵读音乐

诵读音乐是一种基于词语表现形式的表演，较多与音乐，舞台剧，舞蹈相结合，不过本身更重于语言所表达的内容，其他起衬托的作用。
Spoken word is a performance art that is word-based. It often includes collaboration and experimentation with other art forms such as music, theater, and dance. However, spoken word usually tends to focus on the words themselves, the dynamics of tone, gestures, facial expressions, and not so much on the other art forms.
In entertainment, spoken-word performances generally consist of storytelling or poetry, exemplified by people like Hedwig Gorski, Gil Scott Heron and the lengthy monologues by Spalding Gray.

## Experimental Electronic 实验电子

电子音乐与其说是高科技的产物，不如说是时代的产物，与过去的摇滚乐有所不同，它更提倡青年人的参与精神，每一个电子音乐的追随者都坚信只有TECHML近乎一百分贝的震撼，才能使人获得心跳每分钟一百三十下的刺激与享受。它要求并不是用耳朵去听，而是要用全身心去感觉。电子音乐的宗旨是爱、和平、团结，这倒与联合国宪章有着异曲同工之妙，对于电子音乐的崇拜者来说，他们推崇的是少说话多思索的人生态度，追求人性中的真善美，并试图以一种博爱精神和世界大同的家庭观念来消除竞争社会中人与人之间的隔阂与冷漠。　
　　然而，通常电子乐是指当它刚成形时艺术家们通过电子设备所探索出的各种独一无二的声响，以及后人们所创造出的继承这些先驱们的作品。前卫作曲家们长时间的着迷于利用先进的技术手段，创造那些前所未有的电子声响。法国作曲家Edgard Vare是这个领域的一个先驱，早在上世纪20年代就发明了自己的电子乐设备，50年代一直在实验磁带延时技术。Vare的工作极大的影响了美国前卫艺术家John Cage和德国作曲家Karheinz Stockhausen，后两位极大的扩展了电子乐的曲式结构。然而，直到上世纪70年代，音序器和合成器变得越来越便宜和 简便时，电子乐才真正的进入大众的视野。1968年，Wendy Carlos发行了一张带有迷幻性质的Bach专辑，使用Moog合成器实现了Bach的一些音乐片断。这张专辑在公众中引起了极大的反响，Stockhausen对电子乐器的推广也在德国引起了实验音乐的风潮——Krautrock(德国摇滚)。诸如Can和Neu!等乐队开始将合成器和磁带机的使用带入他们的实验，但是这场风潮中最重要的乐队还是Kraftwerk和Tangerine Dream(橙梦)。 Kraftwerk开创了在pop中使用合成器的新观念，他们机器人般的，机械的，催眠性的形式极大的影响了20世纪几乎所有的电子乐。同时，Tangerine Dream受到简约古典作曲技法的启发，创造了一种称为space的音乐形式，顾名思义，这是一种氛围舒缓的， 曰没惚的音乐。其他重要的艺人还包括Klaus Schulze，他探索了比space还要迷幻的音乐形式；Brain Eno，对于电子元素在pop中的应用有着创造性的发明和实验，可是他最出名还是他的ambient music(氛围音乐)——一种依靠合成器创造出某种环境的音乐类型。 Ambient和space音乐引发了后来的new age(新世纪)，后者强调的是一种安宁的，平和的，深邃的氛围并且旋律及其优美。Progressive electronic(激进电子乐)是new age的一个分支，它表现的是一种更加戏剧化，管弦乐使用更多的形式，从而打破了电子乐根基中的简约风格。此外，诸如synth-pop，techno和electronica等音乐形式也都在早期的电子乐基础上有了很大的创新。

Electronic is a broad designation that could be construed to cover many different styles of music -- after all, electronic instrumentation has become commonplace, and much dance-oriented music from the late '80s on is primarily, often exclusively, electronic. However, in this case, it refers mostly to electronic music as it took shape early on, when artists were still exploring the unique possibilities of electronically generated sound, as well as more recent music strongly indebted to those initial experiments. Avant-garde composers had long been fascinated with the ways technology could be used to produce previously unheard textures and combinations of sounds. French composer Edgard Varèse was a pioneer in this field, building his own electronic instruments as early as the 1920s and experimenting with tape loops during the '50s. Varèse's work was hugely influential on American avant-gardist John Cage and German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, both of whom greatly expanded the compositional structures in which electronic devices could be incorporated. But electronic music didn't really begin to enter the wider consciousness until around the 1970s, when sequencers and synthesizers became more affordable and easier to obtain. Wendy Carlos' 1968 Switched-On Bach album, a selection of Bach pieces performed on the Moog synthesizer, had ignited tremendous public attention, and Stockhausen's teachings had begun to inspire a burgeoning experimental music scene in Germany. Krautrock groups such as Can and Neu! integrated synthesizers and tape manipulations into their rabid experimentalism, but the two most important electronic artists to emerge from the scene were Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream. Kraftwerk pioneered the concept of pop music performed exclusively on synthesizers, and their robotic, mechanical, hypnotic style had a tremendous impact on nearly all electronic pop produced in the remainder of the 20th century. Tangerine Dream, meanwhile, was indebted to minimalist classical composition, crafting an atmospheric, slowly shifting, trance-inducing sound that helped invent the genre known as space music. Other crucial figures included Klaus Schulze, who explored a droning variation on space music that was even more trancelike than Tangerine Dream, and Brian Eno, whose inventive production and experiments with electronics in a pop context eventually gave way to his creation of ambient music, which aimed to blend thoroughly into its environment and often relied heavily on synthesizers. Ambient and space music helped give rise to new age, which emphasized the peaceful, soothing, and meditative qualities of those influences while adding greater melodicism; the progressive electronic branch of new age crafted a more dramatic, lushly orchestrated style that broke with electronic music's roots in minimalism. Synth-pop, techno, and its artier companion electronica all owed a great deal to the basic innovations of early electronic artists as well.
