嘻哈音乐（英语：Hip-hop Music，也叫做hip-hop或rap music），是一种跟着伴奏、带着韵律吟诵（饶舌）的音乐风格，诞生于美国1970年代，并于1980年代成为大众流行文化之一。该音乐所用的伴奏多产生于音乐取样手段，亦被称作“嘻哈音乐”，两者均诞生于广义的嘻哈文化。该文化包含了司众（饶舌）、控盘（刮碟）、歇段舞（霹雳舞）和涂鸦等几种街头艺术。

嘻哈音乐及嘻哈文化首先在1970年代美国贫民区的青年中出现，其中大多数是纽约的美国黑人。当时纽约的街区聚会越来越盛行，尤其是在南布朗克斯特别盛行。DJ会在街区聚会中播放流行歌曲的打击乐。嘻哈音乐一开始出现，当时的音乐取样技术及鼓机都已容易取得，且价格不贵。唱盘技术随着歇段间奏（breaks）一起发展，配合牙买加式的Deejay唱法。饶舌是演出者依照乐器或是合成的节拍念词的演出方式。这个阶段的嘻哈称为旧学派嘻哈，著名的艺人有DJ库尔·贺克、闪耀大师与狂暴五人、妙手佛迪、马尔雷·马尔、Afrika Bambaataa、Kool Moe Dee、克帝斯·布罗、Doug E. Fresh、霍迪尼乐团、Warp 9、肥胖男孩及Spoonie Gee。一般认为The Sugarhill Gang1979年的歌曲《Rapper's Delight》是第一首在主流音乐界广为流行的嘻哈音乐。1980年代的嘻哈音乐开始分化，发展出更复杂的音乐风格。在1980年代以前，嘻哈音乐主要局限在美国。不过嘻哈音乐在1980年代开始变成许多国家音乐风格中的一部分。

新学派嘻哈是嘻哈音乐的第二波，起源于1983–84年Run DMC及LL Cool J早期的专辑。黄金年代嘻哈是指1980年代中期到1990年初之间一段创新的年代。著名的艺人有Juice Crew、全民公敌乐团、Eric B & Rakim、Boogie Down Productions、KRS-One、EPMD、Slick Rick、野兽男孩、Kool G Rap、Big Daddy Kane、Ultramagnetic MCs、De La Soul及A Tribe Called Quest等。

帮匪说唱是嘻哈音乐中的一种，强调的是巿中心年轻人的暴力生活型态以及其贫穷的生活条件。Schoolly D、N.W.A、Ice-T、Ice Cube及Geto Boys是建立帮匪说唱风格的艺人。其最为人知的是混合有政治及社会评论的政治说唱及帮匪说唱中的犯罪故事及犯罪元素。

在西海岸嘻哈中，G-funk自1990年代起就主导了主流的嘻哈音乐。1990年代初期至中期的东海岸嘻哈是由非洲中心的爵士说唱及Native Tongues的另类嘻哈主导，而当时硬核说唱也相当流行，艺人有纳斯、武当帮及声名狼藉先生。

1990年代的嘻哈音乐开始和美国各地的音乐风格融合，例如南部嘻哈及亚特兰大嘻哈，同时嘻哈音乐也和其他的流行音乐风格同化，例如新灵魂乐。嘻哈音乐是1990年代中间最畅销的音乐风格之一，流行风潮到21世纪仍延续著。嘻哈音乐也持续在主流音乐发挥影响力。在美国也看到一些相关类型音乐的成功，例如强调节奏及音乐多于歌词内容的旷课乐。不过自2005年起，嘻哈音乐的销售量严重的下滑，在2000年代中期，因为像OutKast及肯伊·威斯特等跨界音乐人的成功，另类嘻哈仍在主流音乐中占有一席之地。 2000年代末直到2010年代初期，小韦恩、Soulja Boy、巴比瑞等人是最受欢迎的饶舌乐手。2010年代，许多歌手像是德雷克、妮姬·米娜、 杰寇以及肯德里克·拉马尔皆取得巨大的商业成功。此时陷阱音乐团体或歌手，如Migos及未来小子也受到欢迎。

Rap's germination is sometimes attributed to the righteous street poetry of the Last Poets and the Watts Prophets, but it didn't begin to take full shape — and earn its tag — until after the Sugarhill Gang released "Rapper's Delight" in 1979. Since then, rap spread from its New York epicenter throughout the remainder of the U.S. (with each region taking on its own specific flavor) and then to countless countries. Rap's core components are beats and rhymes, but that simplicity belies the wide range of sounds that have sprung from them. Instrumentalists, a sampled breakbeat, or a drum machine can form the backbone of a track, while an arrangement can be spaciously spare or chaotically dense, and a chorus can range from atonal shouting to a sweet melody. Detractors were still calling rap a fad in 1985, when LL Cool J released his first single. They were doing the same thing when, roughly 20 years later, the same MC released his tenth album, and they'll probably continue to do so as long as the genre exists. Should rap ever die, which isn't likely, it would be far too late to prevent its effect on most other music forms, from R&B to rock to jazz.

## Pop Rap 流行说唱

流行说唱/Hip-Hop 是适合电台广播的说唱，主要特点是吸引人的旋律与节奏、干净利落的制作，以及噱头的推广，这种风格也称“干净说唱”。相当于用说唱的形式在流行音乐中演唱，主题大多为情感，爱情等主流音乐主题，音乐编曲也更为主流化，可以说是流行音乐对于嘻哈文化的一种借鉴。艺术家包括Will Smith , MC Hammer 和 Young M.C 等，尽管常受硬核说唱者嘲弄，但因注意年轻人的市场而不断掀起强力热潮。

Pop-Rap is a marriage of hip-hop beats and raps with strong melodic hooks, which are usually featured as part of the chorus section in a standard pop-song structure. Pop-rap tends to be less aggressive and lyrically complex than most street-level hip-hop, although during the mid- to late '90s, some artists infused the style with a more hardcore attitude in an attempt to defuse backlash over their accessibility. Pop-rap got its start in the late '80s, when artists like Run-D.M.C., L.L. Cool J, and the Beastie Boys began to cross over into the mainstream. Shortly thereafter, rappers like Tone Loc, Young MC, and DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince recorded singles emphasizing their good-humored storytelling abilities, to massive chart success; a number of other, mostly singles-oriented acts followed in their wake with similarly good-natured party tunes and novelties. With the possibility of popular acceptance very real, other artists -- around the same time -- began to play up rap's connection to R&B and dance music. This latter group often relied on samples to supply their melodies, and with the 1990 explosion of MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice, pop-rap was often derided (and, occasionally, taken to court) for its willingness to borrow hooks from well-known hit songs without altering those appropriations very much, if at all. This gave the style a not entirely deserved bad reputation, since many '90s artists continued to score big pop hits while developing their own distinctive sounds (PM Dawn, Naughty by Nature, House of Pain, Arrested Development, Coolio, Salt-N-Pepa, Sir Mix-a-Lot, etc.). Meanwhile, Dr. Dre's catchy G-funk and Puff Daddy's Hammer-esque plundering of '80s pop hits helped bring gangsta and hardcore themes to the top of the charts; by the end of the '90s, pop-rap was dominated by artists they had influenced and/or mentored, as well as artists who blended rap with urban soul

## Trap Rap 陷阱说唱

陷阱说唱（Trap Rap）起源于美国南部的亚特兰大，是说唱音乐的一个重要分支，也是目前最为流行的说唱风格，它吸收了美国南部流行音乐旋律性极好的特点同样也受到陷阱舞曲（Trap Music）的启发与影响，在听觉上加了很多“冲击效果”的硬式新型舞曲，比如有些低音bass特别沉闷，有些节奏速度快beats又重，还有和声带有迷幻空间感等等。

Form of hip hop characterized by beats with high-pitched synthesizers (often imitating brass or orchestral tones) and hard, frequently polyrhythmic 808 drum machine lines at moderate to slow tempos with fast hi-hats as counterpoints. The term 'trap music' was coined by T.I. with his 2003 album Trap Muzik; as he describes it, the 'trap' is "basically where drugs are sold." Accordingly, in 'trap music', images and descriptions of the drug-dealing lifestyle are invoked heavily. The style evolved in the southern United States--particularly in the Atlanta, Georgia area--in the mid 2000s as a less dance-oriented cousin of Crunk, with a looser and less sharply aggressive vocal delivery characteristic of Dirty South MCs.

Major trap rap artists include Young Jeezy, Gucci Mane, and Waka Flocka Flame.

## Hardcore Hip Hop 硬核说唱

硬核说唱（Hardcore Rap）Hip-Hop之一种，说唱中一种更具有力量感的音乐形式，打破以往说唱及舞曲的形式，具有更强的破坏力和煽动力，其背景总是伴以不断弱化的鼓点，而歌词也大都反映与社会背道而驰或与一般人相异的思维方式。

硬核说唱涉及到好几种不同的音乐感受，其特征可以概括为对峙性和侵略性，它表现为：热情奔放的主题、猛烈强劲的鼓点、吵杂的取样与制作、或是其中任意几种的结合 。

硬核说唱是强硬的、体察民情的、激烈的、而且常常是威胁性的（不过威胁并不是总都存在，它也有幽默和生机勃勃的一面。）匪帮说唱（Gangsta rap）是与硬核说唱最普遍联系的一种风格，二者之间有很多的交叠，特别是在90年代的硬核说唱歌手之中，不过并不是所有的硬核说唱都是围绕着匪盗的主题。最早的硬核说唱出现在80年代后期的东海岸，那时候艺人们开始远离了派对节奏以及对扩音器技术的夸夸其谈，他们的音乐和语言开始反映这个布满沙砾的、粗糙而残酷的城市环境，通常它们也是在这个环境中被创作和被欣赏。在任何关于匪帮说唱的具体准则被制定出来之前，像New Yorks Boogie Down Productions和L.A.s Ice-T这样的艺术家们正把他们对街头生活的观察详尽地记录到磁带中；与此同时，Public Enemy混乱的声音拼贴正为录制能力设定新的标准，而N.W.A则以一种过多的大男子气展现着犹太人与匪徒们荒凉萧瑟的生活方式。

While the term can refer to several different musical sensibilities, Hardcore Rap is marked by confrontation and aggression, whether in the lyrical subject matter, the hard, driving beats, the noisy sampling and production, or any combination thereof. Hardcore rap is tough, streetwise, intense, and often menacing (although the latter isn't always the case; there is room for humor and exuberance as well). Gangsta rap is the style most commonly associated with hardcore rap, but not all hardcore rap revolves around gangsta themes, even though there is a great deal of overlap, especially among hardcore rappers of the '90s. The first hardcore rap came from the East Coast during the late '80s, when artists began to move away from party rhymes and bragging about their microphone skills; their music and language began to reflect the gritty, often harsh urban surroundings in which it was usually created and enjoyed. Before any specific formula for gangsta rap had been invented, artists like New York's Boogie Down Productions and L.A.'s Ice-T were committing detailed observations of street life to tape; plus, Public Enemy's chaotic sound collages were setting new standards for production power, and N.W.A. celebrated the bleakness of the ghetto and the gangsta lifestyle with an over-the-top machismo. In the early '90s, hardcore rap was essentially synonymous with West Coast gangsta rap until the 1993 emergence of the Wu-Tang Clan, whose spare, minimalistic beats and haunting string and piano samples became a widely imitated style. With its slamming, hard-hitting grooves and street-tough urban grit, hardcore rap became hip-hop's most popular crossover style during the latter half of the '90s, its subject matter now a mix of party anthems, gangsta's money/sex/violence obsessions, and occasional social commentary. Artists like the Notorious B.I.G., DMX, and Jay-Z became platinum-selling superstars, and Master P's brand of gangsta-oriented Southern hardcore also became a lucrative commercial force, even if it didn't produce crossover hit singles on the same level.

## West Coast Hip Hop 西岸说唱

在Hip-Hop 世界里，这不仅是一个地理的分割。东西海岸说唱的区别在于它们不同的风格和内容。尽管也受 Hip-Hop 前辈如 Grandmaster Flash 和 Afrika Bambatta 的影响，西海岸说唱比起东海岸说唱，进一步从老派说唱游离开去。他们使用更 funky 的独特节奏，支持着流畅的、有旋律的曲调。西海岸说唱手还率先把“黑帮”文化良莠不分地带入 Hip-Hop 文化的前沿。尽管在说唱乐继续演变的过程中，东西海岸说唱的界限正在慢慢淡化，但仍有一个明显的 西海岸体系，包括从精髓的说唱乐队 N.W.A. 到 Snoop Dogg 和 Vallejo，以及加州的 E-40 等。

1989年时 N.W.A.发行了专辑 Straight Outta Compton ，从此西海岸说唱在它研磨的唱腔与市井的内容之上又加入了更强硬的嗓音，再加上它保持了其原有的作为聚会音乐的基本功能，这一切都使它在90年代成为 hip-hop 的主要力量。另外，南方说唱的兴起也使得东海岸说唱无法再保有其原先的音乐地位，但它也没有在90年代完全消失。除了 Puff Daddy 靠着 Bad Boy 的招牌占据了极其有利的地势并在流行乐坛也极负盛名以外，东海岸说唱还影响了一批风格各异且获得高度评价的艺人们，包括词作鉴赏家 Nas、电子化的 Fugees and Roots、以及受其影响极深的硬核组合 Wu-Tang Clan.


West Coast Rap dominated the hip-hop scene for the middle section of the '90s, making gangsta rap into a popular phenomenon and establishing Dr. Dre as one of the most influential figures in rap history. Still, even if Dre's patented G-funk defined the West Coast sound and style for many, California's rap scene was a great deal more diverse. Up until the mid- to late '80s, West Coast rap mostly imitated East Coast party rap, already considered old-school in its place of origin; however, both Los Angeles and the Bay Area soon proved to be fertile pastures. The former produced the landmark proto-gangsta recordings of Ice-T, the hugely influential, Latino-tinged stoner funk of Cypress Hill, and the warped comedy of the Pharcyde; the Bay Area countered with the pimp-obsessed rhymes of TOO|$HORTToo $hort, the P-Funk-inspired, good-humored Digital Underground, and the pop breakthrough of MC Hammer. In short, West Coast rap became as eclectic and difficult to pigeonhole as East Coast rap. However, N.W.A.'s 1989 gangsta-rap landmarkStraight Outta Compton set the stage for a more identifiable West Coast style — its sound was hard-hitting and minimalistic, its lyrics alternating between violent hedonism and righteously angry social commentary. Upon leaving N.W.A., Ice Cube made solo records which maintained that lyrical tone while employing noisy, Public Enemy-style production; his bandmate Dr. Dre discovered Snoop Doggy Dogg, signed to Death Row Records, and at the end of 1992 released The Chronic, the album that defined G-funk and spawned legions of imitators. The Chronic's gangsta hedonism and production style — whiny synthesizers, rolling P-Funk beats, and deep, slow grooves — provided the blueprint that made Death Row the biggest hip-hop label of the early '90s, scoring hits by Snoop, Warren G.,Tha Dogg Pound, and more. Controversial gangsta star 2Pac joined the label in late 1995 and became a crossover superstar with theDre duet "California Love," and Coolio had taken a more pop-oriented version of the West Coast sound to the top of the charts earlier in the year with "Gangsta's Paradise." However, West Coast dominance soon crumbled — 2Pac was murdered in 1996, Drejumped ship, and Death Row CEO Suge Knight was jailed over business practices. By the end of the '90s, hip-hop's focus had turned back to the East Coast and to the emerging South.

## East Coast Hip Hop 东岸说唱

东海岸说唱/Hip-Hop 总的来说比其西海岸说唱保留了更多的老派风格。Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions, Run-D.M.C. 和其他精华的东海岸艺术家直接引鉴他们的前辈的简朴与直接性，与西海岸的华丽风格形成对比。由此产生了更有棱角的节奏和严谨而又有力的韵律。随着东西海岸的融合，说唱成为两岸文化的合金，清晰明快的东海岸之声继续蓬勃发展，涌现了一批如Nas, Mobb Deep 和Juru the Damaj a 之流的年轻有为的创新艺人。

说唱乐（Rap）一开始几乎全部来自美国东岸（East Coast），而早期重要的说唱歌手（Rappa）也大都出现在纽约，如老派说唱（Oldschool）的传奇人物DJ Kool Herc（来自牙买加的嘻哈之父）、“闪手大师”（Grandmaster Flash）、“祖鲁帮首领”（Africa Bambaataa）、“糖山帮”（The Sugarhill Gang）、柯蒂斯·布洛（Kurtis Blow）以及“饶舌先锋”（Run DMC）等，直到80年代说唱乐逐渐成长且变得更加多元化，也开始在美国各地萌芽。

虽然东岸的说唱开始并无统一性，但从80年代中期至晚期还是可以听的出来它们较倾向于强烈的音乐节奏及取样（Sample）技术。在说唱歌手部分，它们较擅长于反映时事政治并较能引人思考其主题，这也从一定程度上提升了说唱的层次。
东岸说唱的黄金时期知名的说唱歌手有“埃里克·比与拉基姆”（Eric b & Rakim）、“摇摆制造”（Boogie Down Production）、“独眼里克”（Slick Rick）他们用老派说唱等自夸的文字写作并进行说唱，EPMD以及“人民公敌”（Public Enemy）强烈的音乐性和内容的批判性带领东岸说唱乐茁壮成长，“探索一族”（A Tribe Called Quest）、“追魂者”（De La Soul）、“丛林兄弟”（Jungle Brothers）等多数来自纽约的团体，也是影响80年代后期的重要团体，他们的特点是带有爵士味道的音乐性及正面的歌词；自90年代后期，东岸又涌现出一批更巩固东岸力量的“中坚分子”，如稳坐东岸头一把交椅的“声名狼藉先生”（Biggie）、街头诗人“纳斯”（Nas）、硬核（Hardcore）团体“武当派”（Wu-Tang Clan）、把爵士说唱进行到底的“根”（The Roots），爵士说唱节奏（Jazz Beats）大师皮特·罗克（Pete Rock）以及吹牛老爹（Puff Daddy）的商业化的“派队说唱”（Party Rap）……这些人无不对东岸的嘻哈有着莫大的影响。在多样化的音乐发展下，东岸的说唱乐逐渐近化成一种音乐艺术文化，使得东岸说唱乐进而被划分出来，成为社会上倍受尊重且表现细腻的一种音乐。

At the dawn of the hip-hop era, all rap was East Coast rap. All of rap's most important early artists were based in the New York City area — old-school legends like DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, the Sugarhill Gang, Kurtis Blow, and Run-D.M.C. As rap grew and became more diverse over the course of the '80s, productive scenes began to spring up in other locations around the country; nonetheless, East Coast rap dominated through most of the '80s. Although the sound of East Coast rap wasn't completely uniform, from the mid- to late '80s it tended to gravitate to more aggressive beats and sample collages, and many MCs prided themselves on their technical dexterity in crafting lyrics. In other words, with some exceptions East Coast rap became a music intended more for intense listening than for the dancefloor, helping develop the genre into a respected art form as it grew more elaborate and complex. Typifying this golden era of the East Coast sound were artists like Eric B. & Rakim, Boogie Down Productions, and Slick Rick, all of whom boasted immense lyrical skill rooted in old-school style, as well as the harder-hitting sounds of EPMD and Public Enemy. Also based on the East Coast were the Native Tongues, a collective of positive, Afrocentric artists assembled by Afrika Bambaataa; while De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, the Jungle Brothers, and other, mostly New York-based groups had a major impact on hip-hop in the late '80s, they were more readily identified with their musical eclecticism than any specific geographic location. N.W.A's 1989 album Straight Outta Compton served notice that the West Coast had toughened its sound to go along with its already gritty, street-level subject matter; combined with West Coast rap's ability to retain its primary function as party music, this helped make it the dominant force in hip-hop during the '90s. The rise of Southern rap further ensured that East Coast rap could no longer dominate as it once had, but the '90s were hardly a wash for the region. In addition to Puff Daddy's hugely lucrative, pop-accessible Bad Boy label, the East Coast produced its share of varied, highly acclaimed artists, including lyrical virtuoso Nas, the eclectic Fugees and Roots, and the hugely influential hardcore unit Wu-Tang Clan.

## Old-school Hip Hop 老派说唱

老派说唱指的是说唱的初创时期，在 1979-84 期间，当时的节拍更直接，重点在于娱乐，而不是对社会的诠释或讲述堕落的故事。老派说唱的全盛期是由 Sugarhill Gang 的劲曲 "Rapper's Delight" 开始的，随后走红的分别是一些其它单曲，而非某一位艺人。U.T.F.O 的 "Roxanne Roxanne"，Whodini 的 "Freaks Come Out At Night" 和 Kurtis Blow的 "Basketball" 在此期间尽享成功，但是被流行主流所记住的主要是热门单曲，而没有包括他们广泛的其他作品。几个现代乐队如 the Arsonists 和 Jurassic 5 有着明显的老派说唱音调，为新一代听众介绍 B-boy 的精髓，如高能量的合成音韵以及 DJ 的重要性。

Old-School Rap is the style of the very first rap artists who emerged from New York City in the late '70s and early '80s. Old school is easily identified by its relatively simple raps — most lines take up approximately equal amounts of time, and the rhythms of the language rarely twisted around the beats of the song. The cadences usually fell squarely on the beat, and when they didn't, they wouldn't stray for long, returning to the original pattern for quick resolution. The emphasis was not on lyrical technique, but simply on good times — aside from the socially conscious material of Grandmaster Flash, which greatly expanded rap's horizons, most old-school rap had the fun, playful flavor of the block parties and dances at which it was born. In keeping with the laid-back, communal good vibes, old-school rap seemed to have more room and appreciation for female MCs, although none achieved the higher profile ofGrandmaster Flash & the Furious Five or the Sugarhill Gang. Some old-school songs were performed over disco or funk-style tracks, while others featured synthesized backing (this latter type of music, either with or without raps, was known as electro). Old-school rap's recorded history begins with two 1979 singles, Fatback's "King Tim III" and the Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight," although the movement had been taking shape for almost a decade prior. Sugarhill Records quickly became the center for old-school rap, dominating the market until Run-D.M.C. upped the ante for technique and hardcore urban toughness in 1983-84. Their sound and style soon took over the rap world, making old-school's party orientation and '70s funk influences seem outdated. When compared with the more complex rhythms and rhyme schemes of modern-day rap — or even the hip-hop that was being produced less than ten years after "Rapper's Delight" — old-school rap can sound dated and a little unadventurous. However, the best old-school tracks retain their liveliness as great party music no matter what the era, holding up surprisingly well considering all that's happened since.

## Jazz Hip Hop 爵士嘻哈

爵士说唱（Jazz Hip Hop）的起源可以追溯到1920年代的爵士乐，随后受1950年代的波普（Bop）和爵士放克（Jazz Funk）、1970年代的爵士融合（Jazz Fusion）、1980年代的说唱（Hip Hop）的影响，爵士说唱（Jazz Hip Hop）——或者说Jazz-rap——作为一种流派终于在1980年代中期出现，标志为Cargo乐队1985年所发行的唱片《Jazz Rap, Volume One》和Stetsasonic在1988年发行的单曲《Talkin' All That Jazz》。

而真正推动Jazz Hip Hop发展的，是东岸说唱传奇A Tribe Called Quest在1991年发行的唱片《The Low End Theory》和爵士大师Miles Davis于1992年发行的唱片《Doo-Bop》，尤其是前者：RIAA认证白金唱片，《滚石》杂志史上500强唱片第154位，曾入选《时代》杂志史上100强唱片。这两张唱片的器乐演奏姿态属于Jazz，但Beats却是Hip Hop风格，演唱方式也为Rap。同时期还有一大批爵士艺术家和Eastcoast Hiphop歌手同样尝试过Jazz Hip Hop音乐，如Herbie Hancock、Digable Planets 、Us3、Naughty by Nature、De La Soul、Camp Lo甚至大名鼎鼎的“街头诗人”Nas等等，由此，Jazz Hip Hop的发展终于在90年代中期走上正轨，这段时期的代表唱片为《Hand on the Torch》、《Illmatic》、《Uptown Saturday Night》。时间跨过千禧年，众多深受Jazzhiphop影响的音乐人开始活跃起来，譬如J. Rawls、Nujabes、Fat Jon、Madlib、Kero One、Kondori等等。

在这里要提一下Nujabes这位日本音乐人，他将Jazzhiphop传播到东方，同DJ Okawari等日本Hiphoper对日本和中国的Underground Hiphop产生了很深的影响，其代表唱片为《Modal Soul》。而在2010年代的今天，Jazzhiphop的故事仍在继续。

## Southern Hip Hop 南方说唱

南方说唱（Southern hip hop），是美国嘻哈乐的一个流派，兴起于20世纪80年代晚期包括新奥尔良、休斯敦、纳什维尔、亚特兰大、孟菲斯、夏洛特及迈阿密等美国南部城市的夜店之中。

该音乐流派是对自80年代以来从纽约市到加州席卷全美的嘻哈风潮的回应，可视作是继东海岸嘻哈和西海岸嘻哈之后，美国第三大主流嘻哈流派。许多早期的南部嘻哈艺人在90年代由于无法签下唱片合约，选择通过独立发行音乐或混音带。

所有的 Hip-Hop 种类中，南部说唱/Hip-Hop 包括的艺人和风格是最宽泛的。从歌词上讲，南部说唱乐人的共同特点是带有浓重的地方口音。然而音乐上，在不同地区的乐队间的区别各不相同。亚特兰大的 Organized Noize Productions 的创新器乐，就很大程度地区别于新奥尔良的 Cash Money 和 No Limit 的粗旷的合成跳跃风味。而 Underground Kingz（来自德克萨斯州的休斯顿）和 Eightball & MJG（来自田纳西州的孟菲斯）这些乐队则以慷慨深情的、用吉他点缀的动感，进一步扩展了此风格的范围。

历史发展：
在20世纪80年代、90年代，嘻哈音乐主要由东海岸和西海岸的艺人主导。洛杉矶和纽约市是嘻哈乐受到关注的两个主要区域。80年代，南部城市开始发展嘻哈乐。来自休斯敦的说唱组合Geto Boys，是最早受到广泛关注的。南部嘻哈的源起最早可以追溯到Geto Boys在1989年的“Grip It! On That Other Level”以及1990年的专辑《The Geto Boys》，还有1991年的“We Can't Be Stopped”的成功。在他们星途大展之时，休斯敦开始成为南部嘻哈的中心。迈阿密也在南部嘻哈的兴起中扮演了重要角色，同时期兴起的知名艺人有2Live Crew、Uncle Luke等。

90年代，亚特兰大成为南部嘻哈运动的中心城市。如OutKast、Goodie Mob之类的组合在很大程度上帮助南部成为嘻哈乐的一个发展中心。OutKast成员Big Boi和Andre 3000成为专辑销量能和东海岸和西海岸的说唱大腕们媲美的南部艺人。南部最为成功的厂牌则出自90年代中后期的新奥尔良。该市的嘻哈乐吸收了本地特色的Bounce音乐。这种形式最早出现在80年代末纽约说唱组合Showboyz的“Triggerman”一曲中。Cash Money唱片公司、No Limit唱片公司以及已经倒闭的Big Boy唱片公司造就了南方说唱厂牌的商业成功。他们的艺人唱片销量以百万计，并且在嘻哈圈内也获得很高的赞誉。在21世纪初，来自南方的艺人开始涌现。如T.I.、Lil Flip、卢达克里斯、Nappy Roots、Trick Daddy、Trina以及Trae都在这一时期出现在主流音乐界。2004年，OutKast以其专辑《Speakerboxxx/The Love Below》获得六项格莱美奖，其中包括最佳专辑奖。

Long a third wheel to the East Coast and West Coast hip-hop scenes, Southern Rap emerged in the '90s as a fertile scene unto itself, particularly in Miami, New Orleans, and Atlanta. In the late '80s, Southern rap was primarily associated with Miami bass music, also popularly known as "booty rap" both for its rump-shaking grooves and the central preoccupation of its lyrics. Chief among its artists was Luther Campbell's 2 Live Crew, which took the sexual content of its lyrics to a hard-partying extreme, provoking outcries from pro-censorship forces across the country. The sound of Miami bass spread through the rest of the South and remained a national dance-floor staple through the '90s, with artists like Tag Team, 95 South, the 69 Boyz, Quad City DJ's, and Freak Nasty all scoring huge hit singles (albeit with lyrics far less explicit than Campbell's). Atlanta had its share of bass-heavy party rap artists, but also offered a quirkier, more distinctive (and critically acclaimed) style incorporating the funk of classic Southern soul. The cerebral Arrested Development was the first to hit the national scene in 1992, and they were followed a few years later by protégés of the harder-edged Organized Noize production squad, most notably OutKast and Goodie Mob. If Atlanta was the creative center of Southern rap, New Orleans was surely its commercial center. Master P built a lucrative empire with No Limit record label, and even if he and his roster didn't really push the envelope artistically -- most No Limit albums stuck to West Coast G-funk, Wu-Tang-style hardcore, and nothing but straight-up gangsta lyrics -- No Limit pumped out product with assembly-line efficiency and became a constant presence on the national album charts during the late '90s. Toward the end of the decade, fellow New Orleans label Cash Money and its house producer Mannie Fresh -- whose distinctive approach reworked the Southern bass sound -- scored a national breakout with Juvenile, establishing them as a legitimate rival force.

## Midwest Hip Hop 中西部说唱

中西部说唱是指那些由来自美国中西部地区的艺人演唱的一种说唱音乐风格。与之相对应的是美国的东、西、南部说唱风格。
这种风格在九十年代中期开始进入主流视野，例如Bone Thugs-n-Harmony（克利夫兰）、Twista（芝加哥）、Tech N9ne（堪萨斯城）、Atmosphere（明尼阿波利斯）、Eminem（底特律）和Big Sean（底特律）。和东、西、南部说唱具有明显的地域风格不同，定义一个“典型”的中西部说唱可能是非常困难的。
Midwest hip hop is hip hop music performed by artists from the Midwestern United States. In contrast with its East Coast, West Coast and Southern counterparts, Midwest hip hop has very few constants. Its first dose of national popularity came in the mid-90s with the extremely fast-paced styles of rappers known as Choppers, such as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony (Cleveland), Twista (Chicago), Tech N9ne (Kansas City, Missouri), Atmosphere (Minneapolis, Minnesota), Freddie Gibbs (Gary, Indiana), and Eminem/Slim Shady (Detroit, Michigan).
However, while the artists mentioned above became the first to introduce Midwest hip hop that rivaled the popularity of West and East Coast styles, subsequent acts have since risen to national prominence such as Nelly, D12, Common and Kanye West but they share very few similarities. It is because these lack of constants between acts from different cities (and sometimes even between artists from the same city) that it can be extremely difficult to define a "typical" Midwest sound. One characteristic of Midwest hip hop is that beat tempos can range from 90 to about 180, while East Coast's beat tempo is 90–120, West Coast is 100–120, and Southern rap is 80–180.

## British Hip Hop 英伦说唱

尽管英国金属在大不列颠和北爱尔兰联合王国以及欧洲以外很少听说，但却是有英国说唱传统并一脉相承的音乐风格。尽管它没有很受美国hip-hop传统的影响，但许多说唱音乐人却成长在肥沃的加勒比海，因为当地的传统和方言成了hip-hop的风格。应该说说唱开始于80年代后期，“公敌”乐队的声波社团成为一个登陆的标志。很快，许多联合王国的说唱乐家纷纷加入酸性乐房，充实到他们的歌声中，而这类音乐风格在同期比美国更

British hip hop is a genre of music, and a culture that covers a variety of styles of hip hop music made in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland (The United Kingdom).[2] It is generally classified as one of a number of styles of urban music.[3] British hip hop was originally influenced by the dub/toasting introduced to the United Kingdom by Jamaican immigrants in the 1960s–70s, who eventually developed uniquely influenced rapping (or speed-toasting) in order to match the rhythm of the ever-increasing pace and aggression of Jamaican-influenced dub in the UK and to describe street/gang violence, similar to that in the US. UK rap, or speed-toasting, has also been heavily influenced by US hip-hop. British hip hop, particularly that originating from London, was commercially superseded by grime, however, after a post-millennium boom period, the genre remains a hotbed of talent.
In 2003, The Times described British hip hop's broad ranging approach:
"...'UK rap' is a broad sonic church, encompassing anything made in Britain by musicians informed or inspired by hip-hop's possibilities, whose music is a response to the same stimuli that gave birth to rap in New York in the mid-Seventies."

## Jazz Rap 爵士说唱

爵士说唱（Jazz Hip Hop）的起源可以追溯到1920年代的爵士乐，随后受1950年代的波普（Bop）和爵士放克（Jazz Funk）、1970年代的爵士融合（Jazz Fusion）、1980年代的说唱（Hip Hop）的影响，爵士说唱（Jazz Hip Hop）——或者说Jazz-rap——作为一种流派终于在1980年代中期出现，标志为Cargo乐队1985年所发行的唱片《Jazz Rap, Volume One》和Stetsasonic在1988年发行的单曲《Talkin' All That Jazz》。

而真正推动Jazz Hip Hop发展的，是东岸说唱传奇A Tribe Called Quest在1991年发行的唱片《The Low End Theory》和爵士大师Miles Davis于1992年发行的唱片《Doo-Bop》，尤其是前者：RIAA认证白金唱片，《滚石》杂志史上500强唱片第154位，曾入选《时代》杂志史上100强唱片。这两张唱片的器乐演奏姿态属于Jazz，但Beats却是Hip Hop风格，演唱方式也为Rap。同时期还有一大批爵士艺术家和Eastcoast Hiphop歌手同样尝试过Jazz Hip Hop音乐，如Herbie Hancock、Digable Planets 、Us3、Naughty by Nature、De La Soul、Camp Lo甚至大名鼎鼎的“街头诗人”Nas等等，由此，Jazz Hip Hop的发展终于在90年代中期走上正轨，这段时期的代表唱片为《Hand on the Torch》、《Illmatic》、《Uptown Saturday Night》。时间跨过千禧年，众多深受Jazzhiphop影响的音乐人开始活跃起来，譬如J. Rawls、Nujabes、Fat Jon、Madlib、Kero One、Kondori等等。

在这里要提一下Nujabes这位日本音乐人，他将Jazzhiphop传播到东方，同DJ Okawari等日本Hiphoper对日本和中国的Underground Hiphop产生了很深的影响，其代表唱片为《Modal Soul》。而在2010年代的今天，Jazzhiphop的故事仍在继续。（以上多处资料出自维基百科，转自http://weibo.com/u/5129710977的编译）

Precursor：
（2nd ed. London: Rough Guides, 2005） lists Louis Armstrong's 1925 recording of "Heebie Jeebies" in his timeline of hip hop. In the 1970s, The Last Poets, Gil Scott-Heron, and The Watts Prophets placed spoken word and rhymed poetry over jazzy backing tracks. There are also parallels between jazz and the improvised phrasings of freestyle rap. Despite these disparate threads, jazz rap did not coalesce as a genre until the late 80s.

Beginnings of a trend：
In 1985, jazz fusion band Cargo, led by Mike Carr, released the single "Jazz Rap", appearing on the album Jazz Rap, Volume One [1]. In 1988, Gang Starr released the debut single "Words I Manifest", sampling Dizzy Gillespie's 1952 "Night in Tunisia", and Stetsasonic released "Talkin' All That Jazz", sampling Lonnie Liston Smith. Gang Starr's debut LP, No More Mr. Nice Guy （Wild Pitch, 1989）, and their track "Jazz Thing" （CBS, 1990） for the soundtrack of Mo' Better Blues, further popularized the jazz rap style.


Native Tongues：
Groups making up the collective known as the Native Tongues tended toward jazzy releases: these include the Jungle Brothers' debut Straight Out the Jungle （Warlock, 1988） and A Tribe Called Quest's People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm （Jive, 1990） and The Low End Theory （Jive, 1991）. The Low End Theory has become one of hip hop's most acclaimed albums, and also earned praise from jazz bassist Ron Carter, who played double bass on one track. De La Soul's Buhloone Mindstate （Tommy Boy, 1993） featured contributions from Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley, and Pee Wee Ellis, and samples from Eddie Harris, Lou Donaldson, Duke Pearson and Milt Jackson.Also of this period was Toronto-based Dream Warriors' 1991 release And Now the Legacy Begins （4th & B'way/Island/PolyGram）. It produced the hit singles "My Definition of a Boombastic Jazz Style" and "Wash Your Face in My Sink". The first of these was based around a loop taken from Quincy Jones' "Soul Bossa Nova", while the second sampled Count Basie's 1967 rendition of "Hang On Sloopy". Meanwhile, Los Angeles hip hop group Freestyle Fellowship pursued a different route of jazz influence in recordings with unusual time signatures and scat-influenced vocals.


Jazz artists come to hip hop：
Though jazz rap had achieved little mainstream success, jazz legend Miles Davis' final album （released posthumously in 1992）, Doo-Bop, was based around hip hop beats and collaborations with producer Easy Mo Bee. Davis' ex-bandmate Herbie Hancock returned to hipp influences in the mid-nineties, releasing the album Dis Is da Drum in 1994. Jazz musician Branford Marsalis collaborated with Gang Starr's DJ Premier on his Buckshot LeFonque project that same year.


1990s–present：
Digable Planets' 1993 release Reachin' （A New Refutation of Time and Space） was a hit jazz rap record sampling the likes of Don Cherry, Sonny Rollins, Art Blakey, Herbie Mann, Herbie Hancock, Grant Green, and Rahsaan Roland Kirk. It spawned the hit single "Rebirth of Slick （Cool Like Dat）". Also in 1993, Us3 released Hand on the Torch on Blue Note Records. All samples were from the Blue Note catalogue. The single "Cantaloop" was Blue Note's first gold record.

This period was the high-water mark for jazz rap's popularity among hip hop listeners, following which it came to be regarded for a time as a trend which was "played out". Musical jazz references became less obvious and less sustained, and lyrical references to jazz certainly more rare. However, jazz had been added to the palette of hip hop producers, and its influence continued throughout the 1990s whether behind the gritty street-tales of Nas （Illmatic, Columbia, 1994）, or backing the more bohemian sensibilities of acts such as The Roots and Common Sense. Since 2000 it can be detected in the work of producers such as J. Rawls, Nujabes, Fat Jon, Madlib, Kero One, and the English duo The Herbaliser, among others. A project somewhat similar to Buckshot Le Fonque was Brooklyn Funk Essentials, a New York based collective who also released their first LP in 1994. Prince himself contributed to the genre on some songs from 1991-1992, as well as with his New Power Generation album Gold Nigga, which mixed jazz, funk and hip-hop and was released very confidentially.

One hip hop project which continued to maintain a direct connection to jazz was Guru's Jazzmatazz series, which used live jazz musicians in the studio. Spanning from 1993 to 2007, its four volumes assembled jazz luminaries like Freddie Hubbard, Donald Byrd, Courtney Pine, Herbie Hancock, Kenny Garrett and Lonnie Liston Smith, and hip hop performers such as Kool Keith, MC Solaar, Common, and Guru's Gang Starr colleague DJ Premier.

## Comedy Hip Hop 喜剧说唱

喜剧说唱是 Hip-Hop 的轻松一面，远离硬核与黑帮说唱的攻击性和暴力性的形象，喜剧说唱者在现代城市音乐的低音和敲击中加入了风趣和幽默的独特感觉。

Comedy hip hop or comedy rap is a sub-genre of hip hop music that is comedic in nature, often incorporating satirical lyrics. While many examples of comedy hip hop could be considered a parody of the hip hop genre, in the case of artists who merely incorporate humor into their more serious, purist hip hop styles, such as Eminem, this is not necessarily the case.
Before the darker themes that are characteristic of the Gangsta rap of the 1990s, comedy hip hop, with its lighter and more humorous style, came to prominence in the 1980s,[1] carried by popular acts such as the Beastie Boys. Various influential comedy hip hop groups began in the early 1990s, such as Das EFX and Fu-Schnickens, and throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, rappers like Eamon, Hopsin, Eminem, Jon Lajoie, and The Lonely Island gained popularity. Eamon is known for his 2004 hit, "I Love Them Ho's" in 2004. Rucka Rucka Ali is also an artist who experiments with comedy hip hop while touching on social issues like racism, as in his song, "I Can Do Whatever I'm White". "Weird Al" Yankovic has made entries to this music genre, along with Nerdcore. "Thrift Shop" by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis is also a well known song of comedy hip hop. While few rappers make comedy hip hop their focus, the genre maintains a substantial loyal following.

## Underground Hip Hop 地下说唱

当说唱进入地下领域，这个音乐种类自身的进化和逐渐被主流的接受，为那些曾明目张胆反商业或者非常以特立独行自傲的艺术家打开了一扇门。地下说唱并没有特别严苛的定义，它可以是质朴而生猛的，或者非常激进，或者用很低的制作资金来竞争主流说唱。

While rap began in the underground, the genre's evolution and gradual mainstream acceptance opened the door for artists who were brazenly anti-commercial and/or proudly independent, indifferent to the exposure promised by major-label promotion and distribution. Underground Rap has no sonic signifiers. It can be raw and unvarnished (hardcore lyrics over stripped-down beats), left-of-center to an extent that it has no potential to cross over, or emulate mainstream rap production on a low budget. It is an umbrella term that groups weirdoes like Ultramagnetic MC's, firebrands like Paris and the Coup, and gangsta rap entrepreneurs who sell mixtapes out of the trunks of their cars.

## Chinese Underground Hip Hop 中国地下说唱

中国说唱音乐的雏形形成于80年代中期，很多人对于嘻哈文化的启蒙是来自于1984年的美国电影《霹雳舞》（Beat Street）。1984年在北京的俱乐部Juliana's开始有了DJ播放说唱音乐，1992年在北京昆仑饭店的水晶的士高俱乐部里出现了经常性的嘻哈夜现场表演，1994年上海百老汇也出现了嘻哈主题的俱乐部。
2003年，随着北京Vic's和Mix俱乐部的开业说唱音乐变得更加主流。
1986年，香港歌手林子祥发表的《Ahlam日记》是一首粤语说唱，跟当时美国80年代流行的old school的说唱风格是非常相似，崔健于1989年发布的专辑《新长征路上的摇滚》中。收录了一首偏摇滚风格的说唱歌曲《不是我不明白》，算是国语Rap的启蒙。
2002年，来自北京的说唱组合“隐藏”发行了他们的专辑《为人民服务》走进了大众视野。
美国人Dana Burton在2001年开始举办Iron Mic说唱比赛来推广说唱音乐，这项每年举办的比赛在中国说唱界有着十分重要的位置。
2017年，随着爱奇艺的网络节目《中国有嘻哈》的播出，许多中国说唱歌手从地下被大众所熟知，中国说唱也在大众文化中逐渐有了属于自己的位置。

## Conscious Hip Hop 意识说唱

意识说唱是政治说唱的衍生风格，两者是平行的关系，前者主题相对于后者更加宽泛，除了政治主题之外还涉及社会问题，包含移民、经济、非裔美国人文化问题等，跟个人生活息息相关。
Conscious hip hop, or socially conscious hip-hop, is a subgenre of hip hop that challenges the dominant cultural, political, philosophical, and economic consensus,and/or comments on social issues and conflicts. Conscious hip hop is not necessarily overtly political, but the two are sometimes used interchangeably. The term "nation-conscious rap" has been used to more specifically describe hip hop music with strong political messages and themes.Themes of conscious hip hop include afrocentricity, religion, aversion to crime & violence, culture, the economy, or depictions of the struggles of ordinary people. Conscious hip hop often seeks to raise awareness of social issues, leaving the listeners to form their own opinions, rather than aggressively advocating for certain ideas and demanding actions.

## Alternative Hip Hop 另类说唱

大多数说唱乐手常拘泥于一些既有的式样，而另类说唱/Hip-Hop 艺术家则大胆走向新方向。拒绝附和传统老套的说唱风格的一种音乐，比如gangsta、疯克、贝斯、硬核和聚会说唱。

Alternative Rap refers to hip-hop groups that refuse to conform to any of the traditional stereotypes of rap, such as gangsta, funk, bass, hardcore, and party rap. Instead, they blur genres, drawing equally from funk and pop/rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, and even folk. Though Arrested Development and the Fugees managed to cross over into the mainstream, most alternative rap groups are embraced primarily by alternative rock fans, not hip-hop or pop audiences.

## Experimental Hip Hop 实验说唱

实验说唱又叫抽象说唱，是采用了通常被认为是非传统说唱的结构元素的一种说唱音乐风格。一般认为实验说唱起源于说唱音乐的“黄金年代”也就是“八十年代晚期至九十年代早期”。

作为一个相对年轻的音乐风格，这个时期的嘻哈音乐是关于新思想和实验的。在非洲中心主义和政治斗争的主题推动下，再加上实验音乐和采样技术，引发了大量的音乐结构上的创新。

实验性的说唱音乐制作非常兼收并蓄，吸引了大量音乐流派的影响。伴随着电子音乐和配音的元素，艺术家从其他风格，包括摇滚，灵魂，雷鬼，古典和爵士乐。总的来说，实验说唱产生于20世纪90年代早期的嘻哈艺术家，如Wu-Tang Clan，A Tribe Called Quest和De La Soul等。

Experimental hip hop (also known as abstract hip hop) is a style of hip-hop that refers to the experimental use of structural elements outside of hip-hop considered unconventional within the larger hip hop music genre. Definitive Jux, Anticon and Ninja Tune are experimental hip hop and acid jazz labels. Experimental hip hop is usually electronically produced and incorporates turntablism. There are many artists that introduce acoustic elements to the genre to enhance the ability of being played live (this is also notable in trip hop, and its subgenre trip rock).

## French Hip Hop 法国说唱

法国说唱是流行于法语国家的一种说唱类型。法国说唱结合了法语丰富的文化内涵和说唱“自由表达”的精神内核流行于欧洲。

French hip hop is the hip hop music style which was developed in French-speaking countries.

The protest at the heart of French hip-hop can be traced directly to the economic boom following World War II. France required manpower to sustain its newly booming industries and the governmental solution was the mass immigration of peoples from regions of past French colonial occupation to fill the gaps caused by shortage in personnel. As early as 1945, l'Office national d'immigration (ONI) was formed to supervise the immigration of new workers. Newly arrived Africans were not given the same employment opportunities as their French Caribbean counterparts because they were not citizens and often Africans ended up working as civil servants and menial employees living in dilapidated housing projects. Much of the resistance to social and economic imbalances in French hip-hop relate to this historically unequal situation. This is proved by lyrics of Aktivist's song, "Ils ont", The extract when translated states "Aktivist denounces intolerance to all immigrant fathers/Exploited in France since the 50s-60s/...their bodies are falling apart/And their children are still being judged according to their origins."
Many of the French hip hop artists come from the poor urban areas on the outskirts of large cities known as banlieues ("suburbs"). Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Nantes, Lille, Strasbourg, Rennes, Caen, Le Havre, Rouen, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Grenoble and Nice have produced various French hip hop artists. The political and social status of the minority groups living in France have a direct influence on French hip hop.Many French rappers are products of the HLM rent-controlled housing and draw upon their upbringing in this environment as a source of inspiration for their lyrics. France's hip hop scene is, by far, the most active in Europe.

## Christian Hip Hop 基督教说唱

基督教说唱就是在 Hip-Hop 节奏上唱出颂赞歌词。起初，Hip-Hop 的都市生活和暴力的主题与现代基督教音乐的和平与轻松似乎无缘。然而，DC Talk, T-Bone 和 Transformation Crusade 发现这两者的混合体是有观众的。MC Hammer 是第一个以明确的基督主题获得成功的说唱乐者；在 20 世纪 90 年代早期，他创作的热门单曲“Pray”把至今仍在萌芽期的基督教说唱介绍给他的广大听众。

Christian hip hop (originally Gospel rap, also known as Christian rap, Gospel hip hop, holy hip hop, or Christ hop) is a form of hip hop music that uses Christian themes to express the songwriter's faith. Only during the 1990s did this term "Christian hip hop" become descriptive of this type of music. While the audience is typically Christian, the music is also used in (Christian) missions work for the purpose of evangelization. Christian rap and hip hop artists are often professed Christians who often use their background to express their beliefs.

## Hip House 说唱浩室

说唱浩室是一种结合了电子音乐“浩室”风格和说唱音乐的一种音乐类型。这种风格在20世纪80年代后期在芝加哥和纽约崛起之后在美国和英国迅速流行起来。
Hip house, also known as rap house or house rap, is a musical genre that mixes elements of house music and hip-hop. The style rose to prominence during the 1980s in Chicago and New York. Hip house originated in Chicago and quickly became popular across the U.S. and in the UK, with tracks like "Rok Da House" by UK producers the Beatmasters featuring British female emcees the Cookie Crew.
Minor controversy ensued in 1989 when a U.S. record called "Turn Up The Bass" by Tyree Cooper featuring Kool Rock Steady claimed it was the "first hip house record on vinyl". The Beatmasters disputed this, pointing out that "Rok Da House" had originally been written and pressed to vinyl in 1986. The outfit then released "Who’s in the House?" featuring British emcee Merlin, containing the lines "Beatmasters stand to attention, hip house is your invention" and "Watch out Tyree, we come faster". More claims to the hip-house crown were subsequently laid down in tracks by Fast Eddie, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, and Toni Scott.

## Boom Bap 蹦啪说唱

Boom Bap是80年代末到90年代中期的old school style beat，Boom Bap是忠于Hiphop最原始的存在。“The Boom”意味着敲击鼓点，而“Bap”意味着敲击外沿。

In hip-hop music, boom bap is a style of record production. "Boom bap" is an onomatopoeia for the drum sounds prominent in boom bap. The term was popularized by the album Return of the Boom Bap.

It is associated with producers from New York City in the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as DJ Premier, Pete Rock, KRS-One, Ali Shaheed Muhammed, EPMD, Marley Marl, Large Professor, Prince Paul and Scott La Rock. However, it spread far and wide. For example, boom bap is made by People Under the Stairs in Los Angeles and Recordkingz in London. Although it is still made, boom bap is no longer the dominant style of hip-hop production, remaining somewhat prominent in alternative hip hop but rarely appearing in Top 40 hip hop singles. In March 2013, Busta Rhymes claimed his next album would bring the Boom Bap back to hip hop.

## Chill Beats 弛放节拍

弛放节拍Chill Beats是爵士嘻哈（Jazz Hip-Hop）以及器乐嘻哈（Instrumental Hip Hop）的一种派生，包括了Lo-Fi Hip-hop等较为放松的Hip-Hop Beats。这种音乐风格会采样一些爵士乐甚至一些电影对白，加上慢速的节拍，mix成一段慵懒，舒缓的Hip-hop Beats，让人产生非常放松的感觉。

## Cloud Rap 云雾说唱

云雾说唱（Cloud rap）也称Trillwave或based music，是一种说唱音乐风格，具有Lo-fi（低保真）的制作风格和空灵感的人声采样。这种风格给人以“云雾”的感觉，故称云雾说唱。

## Instrumental Hip Hop 器乐嘻哈

器乐嘻哈是一种“去掉人声只留伴奏”的音乐风格。这种风格没有了MC，使制作人能够灵活地创建更复杂，更丰富的细节和多样化的伴奏。这种类型的歌曲可能在不同的音乐方向上流浪，并探索各种子类型，因为乐器不必为MC提供稳定的节拍。虽然自嘻哈音乐诞生以来，制作人已经制作并发行了没有MC的伴奏带，但这些唱片却鲜有出名。
Hip hop productionis the creationof hip hop music. Though the term encompasses all aspects of hip hop music, it is most commonly used to referto the instrumental, non-lyrical aspects of hip hop. This means that hip hop producers are the instrumentalists involved ina work. Modernhip hop productionuses samplers, sequencers, drum machines, synthesizers, turntables, and live instrumentation. A hip hop instrumental is casually referred to as a beat, and a hip hop produceris casually referred to as a beatmaker. However, inthe studio, a hip hop produceralso functions as a traditional record producer, being the personwho is ultimately responsible forthe final sound of a recording.

## Latin Rap 拉丁说唱

拉丁说唱是指由拉丁裔说唱歌手使用拉丁语、西班牙语进行说唱的一种说唱音乐风格，受到很多拉丁歌曲的影响，在北美和拉美地区很受欢迎。
Latin rap music is hip hop performed by artists of Latin America or Latinos in the USA that may contain Spanish lyrics and/or Latin influenced samples.
