> 《PaPa , Can You Hear Me?》选自芭芭拉史翠珊自编自导自演的《杨朵》，一部犹太版的《梁祝》，不过故事的重点在于描写传统社会的犹太少女杨朵，为了求学而女扮男装，追求女性自主与两性平等的过程，而不着重于《梁祝》式的凄美情爱，是一部音乐剧型态的电影。

God

Oh God

May the light

Illuminate the night, the way your spirit illuminates my soul

Papa, can you hear me?

Papa, can you see me?

Papa, can you find me in the night?

Papa, are you near me?

Papa, can you hear me?

Papa, can you help me not to be frightened?

Looking at the skies, I seem to see a million eyes

Which ones are yours?

Where are you now that yesterday

Has waved goodbye and closed its door?

The night is so much darker

The wind is so much colder

The world I see is so much bigger

Now, that I'm alone

Papa, please forgive me

Try to understand me

Papa, don't you know I had no choice?

Can you hear me praying?

Anything I'm saying

Even though the night is filled with voices

I remember ev'rything you taught me

Ev'ry book I've ever read

Can all the words in all the books

Help me to face what lies ahead?

The trees are so much taller

And I feel so much smaller

The moon is twice as lonely

And the stars are half as bright

Papa, how I love you

Papa, how I need you

Papa, how I miss you

Kissing me goodnight
